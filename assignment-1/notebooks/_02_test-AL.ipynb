Prices seem to fluctuate a lot though, but either way this is a terrific gum.  Not only does it have better ingredients than traditional gums, but it tastes better too.  Very intense at first and then mellows.  I like that it doesn't cause cavities (like sugar gums) or cancer (like artificial sweetener gums).  I had debated between this and Spry xylitol gum, but a lot of reviewers said Spry faded quickly and tasted bad. Glad I chose this instead.  Xyloburst is definitely my brand of gum from now on.<br /><br />*Spearmint flavor is also delicious <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019AH24C\">Xyloburst Xylitol Gum Spearmint Blister Pack</a>\n",

      "Well I was hoping that this would be an acceptable substitute for Nabisco Zweiback but it's not. This is not shaped as shown in the picture, it is more like a sliced baguette. The taste is rather bland while Nabisco Zweiback was pleasantly sweet. The texture is much lighter, not as dense and crunchy as Nabisco zweiback. The loosely packed cellophane bags do not protect the rusks from breakage, so I got a whole lot of broken pieces even though there were some air pillow bags in the packing box for filler. So, overall, I am not fond of these rusks and will not order them again. I'll probably use what I have but I'm going to keep trying to find something more like Nabisco Zweiback. If anyone finds a good substitute, let me know. I liked to dip my Nabisco Zweiback in my tea so the product has to be able to stand up to dunking.\n",

      "After trying the Caledonian Kitchen Irish Whiskey Cake, I found it dull and a disappointment to a palate that has been gifted with some of Britons finest Cakes. It is not moist as it should be. It has only a slight hint of Whiskey certainly not obtained from the top shelf. It became pasty as I permitted it to blend in my mouth. The pecans are ground so fine they are lost in the breading and produce only a hint of flavour. If one was to remove the Irish Whiskey from this product you would have a basic run of the mill raisin nut cake that is best eaten with a tall glass of milk to assist in washing it down. In my years I have had numerous authentic Irish Whiskey Cakes including living 3 years in the midlands of England. Tasting a good Irish whiskey cake will initially produce a moist nutty texture on the tongue followed by a moderate but not over powering bath of Irish Whiskey to the palate. It blends with the saliva and becomes similar to a bread pudding texture almost immediately complimented by the raisins. As one swallows, the aroma of the Whiskey remains in the mouth and can be sensed in the nose. It should be moderately sweet, the Whiskey delicate, and the nuts and raisins a compliment to the texture. Even at the low price I would not purchase this product again as it insults the refined integrity of a traditional Irish Whiskey Cake. Most Irish Whiskey cakes will cost you in the neighborhood of $15-20 per pound. I would regard this product to a good Irish Whiskey cake the same as Meatloaf to a Prime Rib.\n",

No lie i literlly said that. and also my mom said WOW THATS A BIG TUB. So when i opened it was sealed like it was said. And now when i opened it, i can smell this STRONG sweet scent. It smelt AWSOME. As i opened it my mom says oooooo that smells good. I wanted to be the very first person to take two pieces and chew them. So my mom tried it, and she liked it and i LOVED IT. But after a while it does loses its taste and it goes into rubbery chew. But i dont care i really do like it. I like the taste AND the rubbery feeling too. So i chew gum constanly like i chew 6 pieces then in half hour i chew another 6 pieces or 10 and spit it out. I go over and over again. So to be honest i LOVE THIS DUBBLE BUBBLE GUM.

While different, that didn't immediately make me confident that the flavors would actually be successful.<br /><br />I decided to buy only one pouch of the Coconut Curry Chicken to try it out. I like curry so if this worked out yay me! Well Yay Me! This was RIDICULOUSLY good. While it was heating in the microwave (as it said to do in the directions) the fragrant aromas started seeping out. I was shocked. This smelled almost exactly like when I make coconut curry sauce on my own. It smelled so fresh and authentic, the only thing left to doubt was the taste. Surely the aroma was just some canned, chemically manufactured olfactory trick. I was happily proven wrong. The taste and the smell all fit together. And unlike Campbell's canned soups, where you had small pieces of of mushy vegetables or meat, here you had big pieces of carrots and chicken and crunchy water chestnuts, the shittake mushrooms were small however, but not negligible.<br /><br />Seriously try it out for yourself. You won't be disappointed. As for me I'm going to go buy a heck of a lot more.\n",

      "I often wonder if I am the only person in the world who cannot stand microwave popcorn.  Give me real corn and a little oil and I am pretty happy.  Then I discovered this popcorn at a kitchen store in my local outlet.  Then they went out of business and I lost my awesome popcorn connection... until now.<br /><br />Wabash Valley Farms is the best popcorn you can get outside of your local multi-plex (though I really like target popcorn too).  You don't need the whirly popper as indicated on the package instructions - I always cook it on the stovetop in a large covered pot; my sister cooks it in one of those fancy carnival poppers.<br /><br />Each pack contains 5 pouches of product. Each pouch contains popping oil, popcorn, and a buttery salt topping (which I only use about half of - it is very fine and very salty). For those that like additional butter, you can add it after popping.  While I cannot attest to the exact amount of popcorn yielded, it does do a good job of filling up my 32-cup Tupperware Thatsa bowl.  Thatsalotta popcorn.<br /><br />The unit cost is $1.66 per pouch, which may seem high when comparing it to microwave popping corn, but you just cannot compare the quality and taste (and when compared to theater popcorn, it is a fraction of the cost). Orville Redenbacher has nothing on Wabash!\n",

      "I have mixed feelings regarding the Red Rain Evergy Shot (Berry Flavor).  It is about the same size and shape of every other energy shot bottle available.  I found the flavor to be preferable to the equivilant 5-Hour Energy shot, tasting less like cough syrup than 5-Hour Energy.  (It DOES have a medicine-y aftertaste that became apparrent about 2 minutes after drinking the shot, and though it's mild, it lasted for about 10 minutes.)<br /><br />One takes these energy shots for, well, a boost of energy, mental acuity, and/or alertness.  I experienced no uptick in any of these departments.  I did have a slight flushing in my cheeks (facial cheeks, mind you), but that's about it as far as discernible effects.  (There was no resultant caffeine crash, either.)  From that perspective, I'd do better with other products.  Every person's body chemistry is different, however, and this product may work well for you.  I didn't notice any of the intended positive effects.\n",

      "I opened the snack cabinet in the office today and found something new: Sun Maid Vanilla Yogurt Raisins. I thought they might be a moderately healthy supplement to my boring lunch, so I opened a box and popped a few in my mouth.  The raisins were plumper than the normal desiccated Sun Maid product, but the yogurt coating was sweet but not distinctive tasting and had a weirdly slick texture after being chewed a couple times. Noting this, I idly checked the ingredients while I waited for my tea to warm up in the microwave. Natural California Raisins, check. Yogurt coating... with partially hydrogenated palm kernel oil. Hmm. The obverse of the box yielded the devilish Nutrition Fact I was looking for: One box of these demons contains 4 grams of saturated fat, or 20% of the recommended daily value.<br /><br />These things are moderately tasty, but for that amount of saturated fat, I want to cram something absolutely delicious in my cake hole (like cake?). I would not recommend these to anyone, and I would definitely never give them to my children thinking they were some kind of healthy snack.\n",

I've never heard of them, but I was feeling kind of thirsty so I ordered a can from the vine program. It's an 8.3 ounce can of 100% carbonated juice (plus gum acacia, natural flavors and colors, ascborbic acid and soy). I don't know what to think about some of the ingredients, but I certainly do know that I like: that it's only 8 ounces and that it has no corn syrup!<br /><br />It tastes very similar to canned Minute Maid drinks, especially the Vallencia Orange offering...but does have a slightly sickly sweet aftertaste.  I don't know if I'd run out and buy a 24 pack, but if I saw this in a restaurant I'd definitely consider it as a tasty complement to a sandwich and potato chip lunch.<br /><br />The last thing I like is about the company: it seems to be an independently owned shop, and I like that.\n",

      "Well it could have been worse. The bonsai was in a healthy condition when it arrived(using standard 4-6 day shipping). However; it was all misshapen and contorted into a very un-bonsai state. The needle foliage was thin(Charlie Brown Christmas tree thin), but very green and vibrant. I know not every juniper bonsai will be the same, but this case is a little shameful to say the least.<br /><br />And at least put a \"This side up\" sticker on the box respectful to the bonsai's orientation, for Pete's sake.  If it's too much for you guys, I'll do it pro-bono. It's already bad enough the plant is subdued to stress in a dark, stuffy, box. You lose stars for that because now I have to train this juniper back to it's natural state--I could be wire training the older parts by now. How about getting familiar with a ruler before going on about 9\" tall juniper in the description. This poor thing doesn't even reach 5\" at best. The pot and the tree combined just make 7\"<br /><br />I really hate to be mean, but this dishonors the respected Brussel's Bonsai name. I only bought this because of the Brussel's name-like most people. What I got can't be 3 years old either. Way too thin- almost a 1/3 of an inch. Thanks for the $20(shipping included) sapling+glazed pot and soil.<br /><br />I could have bought a juniper sapling for a few pennies on the dollar instead of one of these over-priced price pieces of feng shui.<br /><br />All my displeasure set aside- it arrived in good condition and quality(for a sapling). I was hoping for a natural, unpainted pot, but blue is nice. It arrived at a good time. And I'm looking forward to watching it grow over the years to come.<br /><br />One more thing please be honest in the description, thank you.\n",

      "Cute concept, cute name. If you love original peeps, and you love chocolate, Peepsters sounds like a winning combination.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these do not live up to expectations. In fact, they're really not good at all. The marshmallow creme doesn't taste anything like marshmallow. It's got a heavy, thick, sticky texture and an unpleasant, artificial flavor. The chocolate is fairly good quality, but is not tempered correctly so it melts way before you can get it into your mouth. It melts so quickly it will practically slide out of your fingers between the wrapper and your mouth. The one positive note is that Peepsters are so stingy with their creme filling you can barely find any when you bite into them. Which is a good thing, since the filling is cloying and artificial. I love candy, and while I can be a bit of a chocolate snob, I will never pass up or not finish a bite-sized piece of candy. Until now. I couldn't even eat a whole Peepster, which is not even an inch in diameter.<br /><br />Personally, I really don't see Peepsters catching on.

      "The Clear Scalp Damage & Color Repair shampoo is a reasonably good product: it has helped to minimize split ends during use. However, after spending a small fortune on coloring, I'm loathe to use this product: it contains sodium laureth sulfate, which can fade color more rapidly than shampoos without it.<br /><br />The fragrance is almost like a citrus, but a bit too cloying for my preference. The scent doesn't really linger after washing, though, which is good.<br /><br />The major drawback is actually a functional design. The bottle's closure and cap doesn't avoid inadvertent opening and leaking. The product arrived, having opened during shipment, and had spilled all over the inside of the shipping box. This meant a loss of about 1/4-1/3 of the shampoo; had there been other items in the box, they would've been destroyed. A similar issue was encountered when packing it in luggage for a trip.\n",

      "I ordered 4 varieties, one being More Than Gourmet Classic Roastd Vegetable Demi-Glace, 1.5-Ounces (Pack of 6). This one came soft and of gelatin consistency. The supposedly chicken demi glaze came of  very hard consistency, almost like hard glue, so this one called my attention. I immediately rinsed some pinto beans and filled a pot with the right amount of water to cook them and still have some gravy for the brown rice. When I used More Than Gourmet Classic Roastd Vegetable Demi-Glace, 1.5-Ounces (Pack of 6), after it dissolved I served myself a very small cup of the broth. Noticed very little salt. Also a very subtle taste, kind of bland and vague. I do understand that is the nature of vegetables, they are mild in flavor compared to chicken or beef. I liked the color of the water in the early stages and in the latter one I noticed it had caramelized somewhat and had become the perfect consistency to serve. I did add my bag of tricks to the concoction for they do require all manner of spices and herbs if it is to be truly vegetarian. I previously have purchased quite a few vegetable base products, for I have been always in search of the perfect stock in each category, and this one rose to the top. Once it thicken and the beans were soft and velvety and the mix of the other goodies, including caramelized onions, fresh ground garlic, wine, herbs, spices, sea salt, pepper, jalape&ntilde;os properly macerated in olive oil and then lightly grilled to finally blended form, once the final product was ready everyone that ate it (Im just bragging, there were two of us at that time...) said it was magnifique and I congratulated the results by eating double. This one might not have a lot of taste but it certainly melted divinely and made an all vegetarian rendering quite the novelty act. 4 Stars.\n",

      "This is a slightly darker maple syrup, and the flavor is fantastic! Seriously, once you've tried this stuff, you'll never want to go back to the artificially-flavored drek (\"maple-flavored\" syrup).  Yes, it's more expensive, but the taste is worth it. I use it on pancakes and waffles, and brush a little on chunks of sweet potato before roasting them to bring out the sweetness and flavor. Excellent product, good price.\n",

      "I have major problems cooking these on my iron griddle. Although the box says to cook them on a non-stick surface, my well-seasoned, greased iron surface has had no problems releasing food until now (plus it is free of teflon!). I've tried cooking the pancakes three times now. The first day I made the mix I added berries and extra almond milk because the batter seemed too thick. I ended up with burnt, partially cooked gloop and a very messy iron griddle. The second day I tried to match the directions on the box as carefully as possible, and added extra oil to the griddle. The pancakes turned out better, but still stuck to the cooking surface. What seemed to help the most was keeping the heat very low. This morning I tried making them again, with results similiar to the second batch. I will not use this brand again, because I prefer to add berries to my pancakes, and it takes way too long to scrape the burnt bits off my iron griddle!<br /><br />As far as flavor goes, these have a sweet vanilla note without being cloying (which I liked), but they taste strongly of baking powder. They remind me in flavor and texture of mochi, so I suspect that the white rice flour on the ingredient list is a sticky rice flour.<br /><br />All in all, I've had much better luck with other pancake mixes!\n",

      "So, I agree with the criticism that the description isn't 'great' - but others have clarified it - each box has 12 packs - each pack has 12 pieces of gum - since there are two boxes you get 2x12x12 or 288 pieces of gum in all.<br /><br />They taste good - just like regular gum. No hint of caffeine bitterness.<br /><br />I do think that they could have MORE caffeine to be more effective - perhaps 50mg (or 55-60mg) per piece (instead of 40mg ) ... are you listening Jolt ??? However, a good product at a good price with a good twist :)<br /><br />UPDATE:  good good stuff... caffeine helps wake you up, keep you awake when driving, helps weight loss, cuts appetite, gives extra strength when going in the gym.  AND, helps you drink LESS coffee.  I suppose if you have HBP you should avoid it, but, if you don't I love it.\n",

      "StarKist Tuna Chunk Light Pouch In Water, 2.6oz pouches are a very convenient method of eating on the run or preparing a quick meal when time is short. I recently began using Tuna in the pouch and really like how easy it is compared to canned Tuna which requires a can opener and is full of water. The pouch is very easy to open just by tearing the top of the pouch which has a pre-made notch to initiate an easy opening. Once the pouch is open it is not resealable. The Tuna can be eaten directly out of the pouch or you can empty the contents to make a salad or other meal. I now keep some of these Tuna pouches at work and I carry a few in my every day carry (EDC) bag in case I get stuck somewhere and need a quick, easy, and healthy snack to keep me going. I also carry some when hiking, backpacking, or camping.<br /><br />The pouch is relatively strong and would not easily be punctured by an object. As a precaution I do wrap the pouch in a one gallon freezer bag when carrying the Tuna in my EDC bag just as an added measure of caution. Each pouch is considered one portion and contains 80 calories with only 5 calories from fat. Each serving contains 18 grams of protein. The pouch has a label stating that the product may contain bones but I have yet to encounter any bones. This Tuna is a good source of protein and Omega-3 fatty acids. The Tuna is labeled as a product of Thailand and the expiration date is over 2½ years from that date that I purchased the Tuna so it will last awhile and there is no need to be concerned about the expiration date. I have seen this product on sale at a local grocery store for about a dollar which is a great deal.<br /><br />Overall, I am very satisfied with this product and would highly recommend the StarKist Tuna Chunk Light Pouch to others.\n",
