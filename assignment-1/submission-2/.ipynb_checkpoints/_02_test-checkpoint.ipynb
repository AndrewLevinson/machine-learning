Exactly the kind of dog that one enjoys rewarding for her good behavior.<br /><br />And our dog, Asha, seems to look at 7.4 ounce Jumbones as something to which she is entitled.  In short, she loves these treats! She weighs more than she should, so perhaps we are being overindulgent with her, but she loves these so much that it's hard not to provide a supply to last the week for her.<br /><br />For me? I don't know how good these really are.  But, trust me, my dog loves them.\n",

Of these three options, most of which I've tried from several orders, I find the Top Class and Tierra to be the best.  The Super Crema has been the least enjoyable for me, mostly it has been bland.

I'm sorry to say, but Nature's Path Crunchy Vanilla is yet another underfilled box of mediocre cereal with an oddly cloying vanilla-y aftertaste that tastes slightly burnt. Yes there are a number of different grains inside. Yes, the concept is a good idea, but taste is the most important thing for me, and this tastes bad. In fact, 20 minutes after I had it for breakfast, I still taste that weird vanilla flavor.<br /><br />I guess if you must eat gluten-free and the idea of a vanilla cereal is appealing, you might give this a whirl. But for me, when I buy a bag of cereal and the box is tiny and at least 1/3 air, then I feel that I've been cheated, regardless of possible explanations of settling. This box is puny enough as it is, without the underfilling.<br /><br />I didnt like it. It tasted bad, and when I buy cereal, I want a full box.\n",

I've tried Barnum and Keebler before but not this brand so I wanted to get it. These Stauffer's Animal Crackers are a lighter version of both the Barnum and Keebler. They have less fat and calories and taste more like a cracker whereas the other 2 are more like cookies. So I guess you can eat more of these without feeling as guilty. One aspect of these Animal Crackers that really stood out for me is that they have amazing shelf life. The package I bought is not the same as this one on Amazon - it more resembled a potato chip package. So I opened it and ate some and then closed it with a clip and then I forgot about it for a while. It must have been sitting there for about 2 months before I remembered I had it.

We brought him home, resigned that it was really just a matter of time and we would do what we could to keep him comfortable.<br /><br />We decided to give Vitagravy a shot after seeing it in a local pet store. We mix a few drops in his food every day. His improvement was visible and steady from the second or third day.<br /><br />Today, Oskar looks and acts like a much younger cat.

      "I have tried several types of matcha and other forms of green tea, all of which were decent but nothing that compares to this! Now, I'm not a specialist on ceremonial grade matcha (I am simply a green tea enthusiast), but I do know what to look for when determining quality. This matcha arrives in a sealed silver bag, labeled with the type of matcha it is. This bag is within the tin, which has a small plastic cap in order to keep the matcha fresh. Then the tin's actual cap fits on snugly. It is exactly like the picture shows, the dimension of the tin are a little difficult to tell from the picture, but it stands at a little over 2 inches tall (approximately 5.5cm) and the diameter of the tin is a little under 2 inches (~5cm).<br /><br />Upon opening the bag containing the matcha, I immediately noticed the difference between this kind and others I have tried. It is a vibrant green with a very pleasant aroma, slightly sweet smelling. After making myself a cup of usucha, I am very impressed. Some types of matcha I have tried tend to have a little bit of a bitter after taste, but this Uji blended matcha is very smooth. If you are unfamiliar with how to prepare usucha, Theanine gives a brief description under \"Important Information\" on the product page. There are also plenty of videos online if you're confused =)<br /><br />**Update**<br />I've made about 30 cups of tea and I might have enough left to make one or two more cups.\n",

      "This sweetener is not for everything. I think it is specifically made to sprinkle over dry things like cereal. The Eryth. will not dissolve in cold liquids, nor will the fiber. So don't expect it to be like sugar in that regard.<br /><br />It does dissolve redily in hot liquids, but, again, the fiber doesn't. So it may not be to your liking in coffee or tea for that reason.<br /><br />I use it for a variety of applications, mostly for baking, but also to sweeten hot things that have something else in it that will mask the fiber (like baked apples for instance).<br /><br />I make a low-carb chocolate candy and the Sweet Fiber is actually the best choice for this because the fiber will slightly thicken the melted mixture.  If you're interested: mix up 2 tsp. cocoa and 4 tsp. Sweet Fiber. Stir in 4 T warm (liquid) coconut oil. Stir for a while to help dissolve the Eryth. and allow the fiber to thicken the mix (only slightly).  Pour about a half T of mixture (keep stirring it) into mini-muffin wells (about 8).  Add nuts or anything else you like.  Put in freezer to set. Remove 5 mins before eating to take the chill off the candy.\n",

      "Our cats rarely get excited about food - unless their dish of dry food is empty. Then they get a little pissy. So imagine my surprise and delight when I opened a packet of Meow Mix Savory Morsels and had to fend off an attack from these suddenly ravenous beasts. If I had waited just a beat longer in getting the food into the dish, they'd have gone after me like I was a raw steak being carried to their plates by a dozen fat mice. I'm not sure what the folks at Meow Mix put into this stuff - and maybe I don't want to know - but it's enough to send my kitties into a feeding frenzy!\n",

      "KOBE (AKA) Wagyu ('' Wagy'?, literally Japanese cow) refers to several breeds of cattle genetically predisposed to intense marbling and to producing a high percentage of oleaginous unsaturated fat. The meat from wagyu cattle is known worldwide for its marbling characteristics, increased eating quality through a naturally enhanced flavor, tenderness and juiciness, and a high market value. In several areas of Japan, beef is shipped with area names. Some examples are Kobe, Mishima, Matsusaka, 'mi, and Sanda beef. Highly prized for their rich flavor, these cattle produce arguably the finest beef in the world. These different breeds produce beef that range from expensive (by any measure) to extremely expensive (about US$ 50 per 150 grams of filet steak sold retail in Japan).[citation needed]<br /><br />Wagyu cattle's genetic predisposition yields a beef that contains a higher percentage of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids[1] than typical beef. The increased marbling also improves the ratio of monounsaturated fats to saturated fats.<br /><br />United States<br /><br />In the United States, Japanese Wagyu cattle were bred with Angus cattle to create a crossbred animal that would be more able to survive the U.S. climate and ranching methods. The meat of this crossbreed was more marketable to the typical American buyer, for whom the meat of the wagyu cow is \"too white\".[5] The meat of the crossbreed provides the balance of marbling and red meat desired by them. This crossbreed has been named American Style Kobe Beef.[6]<br /><br />Designed to mimic the diet that Japanese cattle were receiving, Wagyu cattle in the United States are fed a mixture of corn, alfalfa, barley and wheat straw.<br /><br />As of 2007, the U.S. cannot ship wagyu beef to Japan, as Japan requires that beef imported from the U.S. be from cattle not older than 20 months; U.S. Wagyu cattle are usually slaughtered at 30-35 months.[7]<br /><br />In Colorado Wagyu beef is being marketed by a ranch near Basalt, Colorado, and the Angus crossbred by a ranch near Rush, Colorado. Wagyu were first competitively exhibited at the National Western Stock Show in 2012.[\n",

      "My dog chewed Booda Bimple bones from puppyhood and he LOVED them. He'd chew for what seemed like hours and drift away into a doggy Zen state. Then Booda changed the formula. They made the bones softer and \"more digestible\" and my dog could eat the largest size in about 10 minutes (he's only 25 pounds!) and the next day it was bad, bad tummy trouble. Instead of chewing pleasure it was gobbling and looking for more. I tried the N-Bone yesterday. I was a little anxious that it would be the same situation, but the N-Bone seems a good bit harder and my dog really had to work at chewing it, which is a good thing. I'm still not sure the N-Bone will last longer than a single chewing session, but at least it didn't get eaten in minutes. I had the package in my briefcase and when my dog passed by, he did a u-turn and started sniffing and pawing at the bag, so I know it is definitely appealing to him.\n",

It was made in January 2009 and has a shelf life of only 8 to 12 months.  It is now September.  I'm not picky and will use it until the farthest date, but some people might be concerned.

I saw this the other day at Sprouts and picked it up on a whim, and I'm sure glad I did. Its delicious. I even like it a little better than Cream of Wheat because it has a little more texture to it.<br /><br />I make mine with water, cook it for 5-6 minutes, than add some organic half&half, sugar, and cinnamon and then stir for a couple more minutes with the heat off to thicken it. By the way, cinnamon doesn't just add flavor but also aids in the stabilizing of blood sugar levels when added to high carb foods so I highly recommend trying it. A bowl of this along with a side of 2 eggs over-easy and some OJ and I'm in breakfast heaven! I intend to try this sweetened with blackstrap molasses one of these days, I'll add an  update if I do.

I had a bad mid-afternoon crash and could hardly keep my eyes open so I drank a bottle of this stuff.  Instantly, I had mid-morning perkiness again.  Magic.  No after effects, but if you're dead tired to begin with you should probably treat the cause rather drinking energy drinks which relieve only the symptoms.  Also, if you have a high metabolism, take a small sip and wait 5 minutes.  Drink only what you need.\n",

      "I ordered 4 varieties, one being More Than Gourmet Classic Roastd Vegetable Demi-Glace, 1.5-Ounces (Pack of 6). This one came soft and of gelatin consistency. The supposedly chicken demi glaze came of  very hard consistency, almost like hard glue, so this one called my attention. I immediately rinsed some pinto beans and filled a pot with the right amount of water to cook them and still have some gravy for the brown rice. When I used More Than Gourmet Classic Roastd Vegetable Demi-Glace, 1.5-Ounces (Pack of 6), after it dissolved I served myself a very small cup of the broth. Noticed very little salt. Also a very subtle taste, kind of bland and vague. I do understand that is the nature of vegetables, they are mild in flavor compared to chicken or beef. I liked the color of the water in the early stages and in the latter one I noticed it had caramelized somewhat and had become the perfect consistency to serve. I did add my bag of tricks to the concoction for they do require all manner of spices and herbs if it is to be truly vegetarian. I previously have purchased quite a few vegetable base products, for I have been always in search of the perfect stock in each category, and this one rose to the top. Once it thicken and the beans were soft and velvety and the mix of the other goodies, including caramelized onions, fresh ground garlic, wine, herbs, spices, sea salt, pepper, jalape&ntilde;os properly macerated in olive oil and then lightly grilled to finally blended form, once the final product was ready everyone that ate it (Im just bragging, there were two of us at that time...) said it was magnifique and I congratulated the results by eating double. This one might not have a lot of taste but it certainly melted divinely and made an all vegetarian rendering quite the novelty act. 4 Stars.\n",
