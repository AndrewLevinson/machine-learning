Obviously not a great health choice if you are going to go through the box in one sitting.  That having been said, they taste great and sometimes are the only thing that hits the spot when you are craving a salty meaty snack.

Therefore won't fit in this narrow bag just wide enough for the scoop itself.<br />  The scoop itself is ok, but I still have my old scoop and I prefer it because the litter flows throw my old scoop better than this one.<br />  Bottom line: if you have a cat that makes just small to mediuim sized clumps, then this product might be ok.  I personally find no value in having the bags inside the hande of the scoop.  In fact I think the feel of the scoop is cumbresone.\n",

Depending on the literature you read, you'll find this described as a \"belgian-type\" yeast. I don't get that at all. It seems like a very plain, average yeast without any significant character except breadiness and yeastiness.<br /><br />Other than the price, I don't like this yeast. I tried it in a cider and a brown ale. It ferments fast and furious and when its done, that's it. This is a work hard play hard yeast. Mega krausen for maybe 36 hours and then that's it. The cider went from 1.056 to 1.008 in about 36 hours. The brown ale on the other hand started at about 1.060 and stuck at 1.030. I tried the usual stuff, swirling the tank, warm temp, nothing.<br /><br />It finishes at a pretty high OG. It left very little apple character in the cider. Easy drinking but not anything special. I've heard people get good results with this. But I think it's a bit tempermental and in all honest not worth the price. When I have to spend $3.50 to pitch a pack of Nottingham to finish was the $2 pack of S-33 didn't, my yeast cost went to a price where I could have just gotten liquid.<br /><br />Not a great combination -- yeasty, bready, poorly flocculating, inconsistent, tempermental.\n",

      "This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.\n",

      "We started buying 100% meat diets on our vet's recommendation for getting our big fatty to lose weight on a \"catkins\" diet. Cats are obligate carnivores, so feeding them other foods that contain rice, or lots of vegetables, really isn't in line with how their bodies have evolved. The vet recommended Before Grain and Wysong, but my cats very clearly told me they like Before Grain much better. They lap it up, have become a healthier weight (the fat one lost, the small one gained), and have had no tummy problems ever since they switched off Friskies and onto this!<br /><br />My understanding is that cats do need a few vitamins, since they do get some semi-digested vegetables from the guts of their prey. We mix in some Wysong \"Call of the Wild\" into the meat.<br /><br />They love the taste of the beef, but it seems to irritate their tummies.  I had a lot of yuckiness to clean up after they eat this, so I don't buy it anymore.  My understanding is that cats naturally eat small fowl and rodents, so quail is actually the closest to what they actually eat in the wild. I have trouble imagining a kitty cat taking down a big ol' cow, so it makes sense that it didn't go over well with them!\n",

      "Most energy drinks like Rockstar, Red Bull, and Monster don't seem to do much for me other than at best make me jittery for a bit, but the problem is they seem to cause a big crash after just a short period. I have tried some of the other energy shot brands, and they just didn't seem to do anything to give me more energy or keep me awake. This past weekend, I had to go to an afterhours party that lasted from 2AM-7AM, so that was the perfect time for me to try the new Red Rain Energy Shot. The taste was OK in a tart berry way, but given it is just 2 ounces, you barely taste the one gulp it takes to finish it. As for the effect, I have to say I guess it worked. I didn't feel any jitteriness or any other overt sensation that it was doing anything, but at the same time, I wasn't feeling tired even at 7AM. Normally, when I do afterhours clubs, I am tired by about 4:30-5AM, so I have to say either the Red Rain worked well or else I just was less tired than usual. Since I only tried one shot as that was all Amazon provided me for review, it is hard to tell from the one test how much it was the shot that helped versus just an unusually alert night. But, it looks good for now, enough that I would certainly try the product again.\n",

Brewing less lets me get the full flavor of the tea from a single bag.<br /><br />Dragonfruit is an exotic, colorful fruit I've had in Hawaii.  It tastes like nothing, if nothing tastes little bit like melon rind and vanilla pudding.  The lack of strong fruit flavor in the tea, then, isn't too surprising.<br /><br />You can find the dragonfruit flavor if you look for it, but it's a subtle rounding influence that binds the herbs and spices of the tea together and is nearly lost under the stronger orange peel flavor.  The top notes are the ginger and other spices that make this tea almost an herbal \"chai remix,\" sans black tea.  Although there is no clove in the tea, the chicory and damiana do a good impersonation of it, but with a cost:  they impart more bitterness to the beverage.<br /><br />If you like chai and believe you would still like it without the nutmeg and other \"pumpkin pie spices,\" and if you like a bit of bitterness in your lightly and naturally sweet herbal tea, this could absolutely be your favorite tea.

      "I'm sitting here this morning having a cup of Melitta Cafe Collection Blanc et Noir as I peruse the paper and facebook and look for goodies on Amazon. Let me just say that I really like this fine blend of the dark and light coffees. What you get is a coffee that's very drinkable with or without cream, as light on the palate as any American breakfast coffee. Yet there are wonderful subdued flavors of the darker and richer coffees one might expect down at the local coffee shop. My normal cup of home-brew is something along the lines of Starbucks Cafe Estima or Sumatra, so I do like the heavier, darker brews. And this Blanc et Noir just hints at those beans in a beverage which is smooth and aromatic and suitable for nearly every occasion. If you like the flavors of the darker brews but find the full-bore coffees sometimes overpowering, this is the blend for you. Blanc et Noir finishes with mild tones of citrus. Very nice.\n",

This is an excellent combination of flavors that I was not always able to find at local stores. And with subscribe and save it is cheaper and delivered to my door.<br /><br />The flavors are vegetable turkey which lists the ingredients as Water, organic carrots, organic apples, organic ground turkey, organic whole barley flour.<br /><br />Sweet potato and chicken: Water, organic sweet potatoes, organic apricot puree, mechanically separated organic chicken, organic brown rice flour.<br /><br />Summer vegetable: Water, organic corn, organic zucchini, organic green beans, organic brown rice, organic carrots, organic garbanzo beans, organic canola oil.<br /><br />Rice and Lentil: Water, organic apples, organic carrots, organic brown rice, organic lentils, organic canola oil<br /><br />There are other Earth Best blends where water is not the number one ingredient.

The water being first in all 4 is giving me pause as to the overall value and definitely something I will keep in mind as to trying other brands going forward.

      "My canine companion is a 132 pound, five year old, Shiloh Shepherd.  The Shiloh Shepherd is considered a 'giant breed.'  With his enormous size, athleticism, and the general nutrient demands, we all must consider, his diet has always been a primary consideration.  Not to mention, he has the sensitive tummy often seen among the German Shepherd breed.  His breeder has always been partial to 'Premium Edge Lamb.'  This is the formula he was weaned on.  I had no desire to change what appeared to be a successful regimen.<br /><br />Then to my dismay, I learned 'Premium Edge' was placed on a recent recall list.  I knew that a change in diet was likely to be detrimental to my fur friend, but I had to take immediate action.  And, at the time of recall, I didn't have time to gradually transition to a new diet, which is always the way to go, to avoid negative symptoms.<br /><br />After carefully analyzing formulas of numerous dry kibble, I opted to give Pinnacle (Trout & Sweet Potato) a try, ordering a 15 pound 'starter' bag from Amazon.  In addition, I ordered some digestive enzymes to assist in the transition phase.<br /><br />The bag arrived.  I opened it with my dog assisting to see what his response would be.  The first whiff out of the bag was strong, smelling of fish.  I noted the kibble size, itself, was quite small for a large breed dog, but felt this was only a minor reservation.  The ultimate test was not what I thought about it, but what my Shiloh would.  He immediately had a positive response.  In fact --- he loves it!  He appears more enthusiastic about it than the 'Premium Edge.'<br /><br />I had to start the Pinnacle before the enzymes arrived, so I was expecting some terrible gas and possibly some diarrhea.  Well, that was not the case.  He has gone through the 15 pound bag, and half of the next order --- a 30 pound bag, with no diarrhea, or gas, at all.  In fact, his stools appear firmer and more consistent than on his previous diet.  Supplementing with the enzymes was actually not necessary.<br /><br />I'm delighted with this new regimen.  I also love that I can order a 30 pound bag through Amazon and have it delivered to my front door.  I'm now avoiding a considerable drive,  and,  the back-breaking-discomfort, of lugging around heavy bags of kibble.<br /><br />My dog is happy, and I'm happy.  That said, after an adequate therapeutic trial, I feel confident in recommending Pinnacle.\n",

      "First you need to get 'normal' noodles out of your head and think of these noodles as 'noodles' only in shape and size. Otherwise they are a completely different experience, one I personally like as much as wheat or rice noodles. If you buy these noodles hoping for something that tastes like normal noodles you will probably be disappointed. I bought these with an open mind - hoping that I would be able to add something to my routine without breaking my extremely low calorie diet. I have to say that these guilt-free noodles are fantastic - not rubbery or too chewy - the texture is more like mushrooms made into noodles. They don't taste like much of anything actually, and I didn't notice any smell in particular. They are perfect for adding bulk and texture to a meal without adding calories.<br /><br />I am ready to sign up for a subscription for these noodles to save a little money and because I know I will be using them regularly. Asian noodle recipes are particularly well-suited for these noodles (as opposed to Italian-style meals.)<br /><br />I highly recommend this product... for what it is.\n",

It works great with water, but I tried it with milk and it truly enhances that product also...it even blends well with chocolate milk and produces a good flavor.  I also tried it with coffee...the result was interesting, but I'll stick with using it with water and milk.<br /><br />It also seems to me that my energy level is a bit higher during the week that I've been using this.  I'm 79 and am tired more often than I should be...the past week, I've noticed that I've been noticeably less tired, so I am sold on this product.<br /><br />The one criticism is that a \"squeeze\" is an indeterminate amount and I don't always get quite the right amount.

It's creamy (as advertised), thick, probably loaded with too much sugar for its own good, and delicious if you like this All-American food. Planters peanut butter may have a slightly more nutty taste than its competitors, but not by much. Also, at 16.3 ounces, this jar of peanut butter is not too big or too small; it's just the right amount in my opinion.<br /><br />As a testament to how good Planters peanut butter is, I purchased it at the grocery store after receiving it via Amazon's Vine program.

There are many grain-free choices out there, so I would personally highly recommend trying different kinds to see what your dog likes - I have to admit that I haven't seen many low-fat grain-free kibble products, so this is the one I went with.

      "I am careful about the food that I select for my cats because I want them to be healthy.  Unlike dogs, cats are strict carnivores, so any fillers in cat food are unnecessary and potentially harmful.  Also, cats have a very short digestive tract, so though fiber is good for humans, it is not important for cats.  Finding a cat food that meets these stipulations takes quite a bit of research.<br /><br />Petite Cuisine makes the mark.  The first three ingredients in each of the formulations in these variety packs are fish broth, and two different fish meats.  There is no trace of any grain fillers, and of course no wheat gluten, which was the source of the melanine tainting that has now killed and sickened humans as well as pets.<br /><br />The guaranteed analysis on the cat foods is crude protein - 13% min, crude fat - 1.5% min, crude fiber - 1% max, moisture - 85% max, ash - 3% max, and taurine 0.1% min.<br /><br />My cats of course love it.  They even seem to take a little time to savor the meal, and the food has caused zero digestive difficulties.<br /><br />The consistency is similar to a can of BumbleBee tuna, with fish chunks in a broth.  In fact, I could probably use this cat food to make a tuna fish salad, and no human would be the wiser (except for the accusatory and incriminating looks of the cats.)<br /><br />The recommended daily ration for this cat food for an adult cat is 1-2 cans per 2 1/2 pounds of body weight, which is a bit higher than my other canned cat food.<br /><br />Overall, this is the finest cat food that I've come across so far.  I'll probably use it as a supplement to brand that I feed as a mainstay.\n",

Rich, sweet, gorgeous color.  Incredible price for ORGANIC San Marzanos - my pantry will never be without a case of these ready to go - with these on hand I can whip up something pretty impressive on the fly.  And I never have to reach for a can of tomato paste to add body or extra tomato umph to sauces - this provides plenty.<br /><br />So yeah - these do not have the official DOP designation - but the flavor is what counts and these have it in abundance.<br /><br />I have not yet had a problem with receiving dented or otherwise damaged cans - this will be my 4th case from Amazon.  Also - gotta admit I love the pull-tab lids - not a reason for buying a specific brand of tomatoes certainly, but it is a nice bonus for this lazy girl.<br /><br />As I will continue to order these as long as they are offered and I am still cooking, I will be sure to update if I receive a damaged case.

Try mixing one pouch of raspberry lemonade with one pouch of the Margarita flavor, now THAT is pretty darn tasty!<br /><br />As a margarita, it's not even close.

If you like a nice strong French roast style, this coffee is for you.  No bitterness at all.  This brew is smooth and full bodied, even on the larger cup choice of my Keurig.  Most coffees I have to brew on the smaller cup choice.  Wish this came in decaf, but until then I can only have one cup in the morning as I am very sensitive to caffeine.\n",

      "Bigelow French Vanilla Tea is my favorite breakfast tea....can't start my day without it.  Sadly, it has been disappearing from my local grocers' shelves and I can only find it in one specialty store.  Specialty stores have special high prices & several yummy, unhealthy temptations that I try to stay away from.  I turned to Amazon, and there was my tea.  I signed up to get six boxes delivered to my door every 3 months.  This convenient service costs me just a little over half what I was paying at the specialty store.  There was a mix up with my first order that caused me to receive 2 shipments at once, but I have been assured that this has been sorted out.<br />I would highly recommend this tea to any tea drinker.  The vanilla flavoring can't be missed, but is not so strong that it overpowers the tea.  This tea has never tasted bitter or \"strong enough to trot a mouse\" even when I go over the brew time.  Always delivers a smooth flavorful cuppa. It's not an exotic, upmarket tea, but if you are looking for a good, smooth tasting everyday cup of tea, give this one a try.  I give the tea 5 stars and the convenient Amazon delivery 4 & 1/2 stars that maybe should also be 5 star.  I did get a double order....could have been my human error, or their human error or computer glitch.  Customer service was excellent and the duplicate was returned at no cost to myself.  Overall, I am 5 star happy with both product and Amazon.<br />The Amazon provided price of $14.ish drops to $12.ish when you sign up for the regular scheduled delivery....and free shipping...whatta deal!\n",

      "I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy the adorable cat on the commercials. My cats did eat this food, in fact they really enjoyed it. However, after reading the ingredients and doing some research, I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first three ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are ground yellow corn, corn gluten meal, and chicken by-product meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a cheap corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: \"When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with cats and dogs.\" Basically, corn cannot be fully digested, it is just a filler and causes pets to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more (more for us to clean in the litter box), and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Friskies at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I think the only reason why it was cat-approved may be because it contains artificial flavors that taste good to cats and because I usually feed them dry food for dental reasons and wet food puts off much more of a scent for them to enjoy. I recommend to stay far away from Friskies, as it is simply a very low quality filler food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat meat, and there just isn't real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, dry foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or corn.\n",

It quickly became a regular morning ritual with the cats sitting patiently in the kitchen each morning when I entered.  As time went on it became harder and harder to find The Tuna Entree at Walmart.  Sometimes I would drive to two different stores looking for it.

In December when I was back in the U.S., after not being able to find this in the local stores, I turned to Amazon and I was so happy to not only find it available on here but we can get it shipped automatically  every 4 weeks.  Now, the cats always have their special morning meal and my daughter doesn't have to drive around looking for it.

The taste is rather bland while Nabisco Zweiback was pleasantly sweet. The texture is much lighter, not as dense and crunchy as Nabisco zweiback.

      "During the late 1990's and early 2000's, this was one of my favorites.  Back then, the 750ml bottle was the only option; I would purchase it to share with friends, trying to introduce them to something new in the beer world.  Strangely, the beer then left the Minnesota markets for a couple of years.  Needless to say I was quite displeased with this.  Despite my efforts, there was just no way that I could logistically get my hands on this now precious and coveted ale.  Then just a couple of years ago, Leffe resurfaced again - this time exclusively in 6 pack form.  Moreover, it was now in virtually every liquor store that carried at least a minimal selection of imported beers.  Although I was pleased that Leffe had returned, it just didn't feel quite right; it was now too ubiquitous, and I missed the old 750 ml corked bottles.  Now, in the past year or so, the 750ml bottles have returned.  Additionally, the sticker price is surprisingly much cheaper (approximately $4 - $6) than its Belgian competitors.  Once again, I was glad to see the return of the quintessentially Belgian corked bottle for Leffe.  However, the significantly reduced cost of the ale made me a bit suspicious.  Regardless, like reacquainting with an old friend, I decided to pick up a bottle to see if Leffe was still one of Belgium's finest.  While there is no doubt that Leffe is still a quality Belgian ale, there seems to be something slightly different with this product, some subtilities that seem to be lacking.  I noticed it mainly in the finish of the beer; there seemed to be a vaguely noticeable \"thinness\" that I've sometimes associated with cheaper quality American brews.  I started to \"smell a rat,\" so I decided to dig a little bit deeper into recent information about Leffe; what I uncovered made my heart sink a little bit...<br />It seems that one major step in the wrong direction for Leffe occurred in 2004.  It was during this time that Interbrew, the company that owned the rights to Leffe, merged with the Brazilian brewing company AmBev.  Changing the company name to InBev following the merger, the conglomerate earned itself a very negative reputation as a ruthless predator in the beer manufacturing world. It is also noteworthy to point out that this was roughly the same time period in which Leffe became conspicuously absent from the shelves of Minneapolis liquor stores.  Coincidence?  Maybe, but I'm willing to bet that it wasn't.  In November 2008, InBev purchased Budweiser giant Anheuser-Busch for $52 billion. Changing the name to \"Anheuser-Busch InBev\" (or \"AB InBev\" for short), the newly formed conglomerate was now the world's #1 beer manufacturer.  Moreover, multiple resources that I read cited the fact that AB InBev was now using corn and other cost-effective measures in their brewing process for Leffe -- something that was not being done previously.  In one fell swoop, this explains the recent widespread distribution, the suspiciously low cost, and the noticeably different taste of a once great Belgian ale.  As I write this, I keep shaking my head; I feel a bit duped and betrayed (unfortunately, Leffe is just the tip of the iceberg - other quality beers such as Franziskaner, Bass,  Goose Island, and Hoegaarden are also owned by AB InBev).<br /><br />By most accounts that I've read, AB InBev seems to have garnered a reputation for buying up smaller beer companies and either callously altering their brewing processes (in the name of cost-effective measures) or working toward closing the products lines down altogether.  There's lots of negative information out there in regard to this company... I may need to reconsider how often ( if at all) I should purchase products that support such a dubious organization.\n",

      "After some research, I changed my cat to this shortly after I got her from the Humane Society, which sent her home with some Purina, or something. We both love it. She'll eat it all day and night, and she's stayed super healthy.<br /><br />One thing though is to watch portion sizes. When I got my cat, she was barely 5 pounds. I was feeding her 3 times a day, a quarter cup each, and she started growing really fast. When she hit 10 pounds, I dropped down to twice a day, still a quarter cup each. Eventually she got to 13 pounds and was starting to look pudgy. I dropped her down to a quarter cup in the morning and half of that at night, and she's stayed consistent at about 11 pounds and well proportioned. That's about half of what the bag says a cat of her age and weight \"should\" eat. I feel that if she ate all that she would get fat.<br /><br />Watch how much you feed your cat, adjust portions to their activity level, and be sure they have plenty of water. This cat food is not the cheapest, but it's very good. For my money, I won't buy anything else.\n",

So, I tried this out of curiosity and simply put, I'm impressed....it is excellent. I tried it in the morning, but I think it would be fine whenever one desired tea.

      "First had Lavazza at a local coffee shop and was floored. To me, this is what coffee should taste like. It is bold and strong, but no bitterness whatsoever. I recently bought a Curtis commercial coffee maker and was hoping for the same experience from my office and home. After a few different coffees (mostly local whole bean), I was disappointed that my coffee wasn't turning out as good as the cafe I went to. To my surprise, the next time I visited the local grocery store, I saw this Lavazza brand in the Italian isle. I immediately bought it and brewed it that night. After the first sip, I knew I had hit the jackpot. This is what I have been waiting for. All along it had been the coffee making the difference. The Curtis helps significantly with ensuring the proper temperature of the brew, but it is really the coffee that makes all the difference. I am impressed in the packaging and was surprised how packed they are able to get the ground coffee.<br /><br />BTW - I have only used this for my drip coffee maker - have not used it for espresso yet. For my taste, one coffee scoop (1/8 cup / or 2 tablespoons) for every 16 oz of water.<br /><br />As long as Amazon or my local grocer carries this coffee, I will be buying it. Wish I could give it more than 5 stars. .\n",

      "Well, Weruva had the magic formula in the past. Their Marbella Paella was at THE very top of our pets' list of favorite foods and they eat about 10-12 different brands/flavors of canned foods, all premium brands without grains and crap fillers. The old Marbella Paella recipe and the new both had mackerel as the primary ingredient and water as the second ingredient. The previous recipe, which is still what's incorrectly printed in Amazon's description as of this writing, contained calamari, shrimp and mussels as third, fourth and fifth ingredients. Now calamari, shrimp and mussels are entirely absent in any amount from Marbella Paella. If you ask me, this is such a fundamental change in the recipe that it constitutes deceptive marketing for returning customers like myself. And I DO feel deceived.<br /><br />And there is no question that our pets notice the change. They used to DEVOUR the previous Marbella Paella and leave cleaned bowls behind and ask for seconds. Now they walk away leaving their bowls half full the way they do with non-Weruva brand foods. Sure, they'll eventually come back and finish up. And that's how they generally are with their other foods. So no, they don't dislike the new recipe. They just seem rather indifferent.<br /><br />It is VERY disappointing how far from grace this recipe has fallen. From paragon to mediocrity in one shot. Lame.<br /><br />Hey, Weruva, change the name of this product or restore the previous recipe. It ain't cool to ride the success of your previous recipe and deliver this sorry impostor in its place. Talk about a LITERAL bait and switch. Very uncool...<br /><br />Still, most other truly premium pet foods that have healthy ingredients and are void of grains and preservatives, etc. typically get snubbed by our pets and the new Marbella Paella still does actually get eaten so it gets 3 stars whereas other premiums typically get 1 or 2 stars because our pets simply won't eat them. The original Marbella Paella, of course, would have gotten 6 stars if Amazon would allow that extra star.<br /><br />Sad... but at least the little ones still eat it...\n",

      "Amora is to the French what Heinz ketchup is to Americans - a national institution and the preferred condiment of choice for everything from frites to you-name-it. I've enjoyed Amora mustard since I first tried it in Paris 30 years ago. I add it to everything: barbecue sauce, salad dressing (try a teaspoon of it in your Caesar dressing!), marinades, and by itself on lots of foods. Everyone I have ever shared it with raves about it, and now you can have it without having to go to France (or pay exorbitant shipping) to get it.<br /><br />Many years ago, it was available in specialty and gourmet food shops, but when the original family-owned company changed hands some years ago (they were bought out by Maille, I believe, which was then bought out by an American company), there was apparently a trademark issue that prevented them from importing it directly to the United States. Like other reviewers, I packed it home by the case when I visited France and begged friends to bring some for me when they could. A few years ago I began buying their small jars by the case (to save on shipping costs) from an outfit in NYC; recently, though, a local Northwest company began offering the larger jars, and now one can buy it on Amazon.<br /><br />Try a small jar if you're uncertain, or just plunge in and buy a big jar and enjoy it. And buy lots of little jars to give as gifts - any \"foodie\" you know will be grateful to have this! Yay, Amazon!\n",

      "I have always been a lover of all things caramel. I've probably tried every caramel cookie, cake, ice cream, tea, coffee, pastry, and countless other items that contain caramel. But I am very picky about caramel flavorings. Many of them taste too artificial, butterscotch-y, or are just too faint for me to enjoy. Happily, this Caramel Matcha did not disappoint me. When I received the package in the mail, I immediately knew my Matcha had arrived. There was a wonderful, strong smell of candy-like caramel coming from the package. After actually opening the package and smelling more caramel goodness, I knew I was in for a treat.<br /><br />I decided to try this as a latte. So I prepared it using my usual method of 2 grams Matcha, 2 ounces of skim milk, 3-4 scoops of stevia, and 6 ounces of water. I whisked this up using my electric milk frother and tried it. It was very good, but a little strong. After adding another 2 ounces of water, it was close to perfection. This Matcha is very smooth and rich. Even though I used very little milk, it tasted so creamy. The caramel flavor is just right - enough flavor that you can definitely taste it, but not enough to outshine the flavor of the Matcha. This may be one of the best drinks I've ever made at home, and I'm actually kind of proud.\n",

If you like the smell of tea leaves (and I recognize that many people don't), the litter is fine when new and dry. But once a cat actually uses the litter, the smell just mixes with poop and pee. It turns out, poop and pee smell bad, but poop and pee mixed with green tea smells awful.<br /><br />Also, while the pellet size is larger than most clumping litter, the tracking is actually worse because the pellets are very light weight for their size. Plus, clumping is below average. I tried to use this in a sifting litter box, and the litter doesn't stick strong enough for the clumps to keep their shape.\n",

With that said Im pretty pleased with or am OK with most of the flavors that ive tried. Bellow are my reviews of a few.<br /><br />Cola: 5/5 stars Doesnt taste exactly like Coke but is close. One of my favorites.<br /><br />Orange: 5/5 stars If youve tried different brands of Orange soda you will notice that some taste better than others. This tastes like cheaper dollar store orange soda, so is similar to Sunkist, but it still tastes pretty good & does taste like a known orange soda.<br /><br />Lemon Lime (Sprite): 4/5 Tastes like Sprite at first but leaves an odd after taste. Ive noticed that if you open your mouth after each drink the after taste is minimal. If it werent for the after taste I would give it 5 stars.<br /><br />Cranberry Raspberry: 5/5 Not sure what to compare it to, but it tastes great with no weird after flavor.<br /><br />Energy: 5/5 This came in the trial pack, & since im not into energy drinks I sipped it & had a friend try it. It gets 5 stars because it tastes just like Red Bull according to both of us.<br /><br />Dr. Pete: 3/5 Its OK but it tastes pretty vanillaish & not all that close to Dr. Pepper. You can sort of taste the similarity but not enough to say \"WOW! JUST like or very similar to Dr. Pepper!!!\".<br /><br />Overall Im still a big Sodastream fan, & most of the flavors ive tried I would buy again.\n",

      "I like bold coffee, which this was promoted as a bold, dark brew. I've had better but this isn't bad. It has a dark roast flavor that really attacks the palette, leaving a slightly bitter aftertaste, which I don't really care for. I'm glad I tried it and I have enjoyed it as my morning brew but I probably wouldn't order another box. I have also experienced some of the kcups leaking during the brewing, spreading dark, hot coffee with the grounds all over and down the front of the brewer leaving an absolute mess. It's bad enough for this to happen once in awhile, but this has happened three times and I'm not even half-way through the box (BTW, Amazon's frustration-free packaging is really great!). I see what is happening is that the foil on the top of the cup breaks loose allowing the coffee to be forced out over the top. Now, I must look over each KCup very carefully before I use it. Maybe I just got a bad batch but I can't wait for it to be gone.<br />UPDATE. I separated out the cups that look like they might explode. Of the 28 kcups left, 17 (over half) looked like they would fail. I was right on all but 4 of them! With this batch of 50 kcups, nearly half of them failed during the brewing process. This is by far the worst batch of KCups I have ever used. I will definitely, never, ever, buy these again.\n",

Justin's Chocolate Hazelnut butter wins hands down in the tastiest AND the most healthful category. It is not a cloying 75% sugar as regular nutella is, does not have shady ingredients and you can actually taste the chunky toasted hazelnuts in the butter. It is amazing on just about everything, toasted bread, Granny Smith chunks, peanuts, pretzels, pita bread and really, anything you can think of. Amazon's price for 3 1lb jars of Justin's Hazelnut butter is unbeatable. It is at least $3-$5 costlier at Target, Whole Foods and wherever else it's usually sold.

When he inadvertently discovers that the school chapel has been erected atop the former lair of a medieval Satanist, Coopersmith invokes the spirit of the deceased devil-worshipper and enlists the ghost's aid in exacting revenge on his tormentors.<br /><br />The underdog-gets-the-upperhand-via-the-supernatural plot of EVILSPEAK is cliche, but Clint Howard's affecting performance and Eric Weston's capable direction elevate the film above its formulaic roots.  Gore fans won't be disappointed, as included in the blood-and-guts scenes are a decapitation, a nail through the forehead, an evisceration, and lots more.  The flick is a bit sparse on the requisite T&A, though skin-seekers should find beautiful Lynn Hancock's shower scene quite enjoyable.  Fans will recognize genre regular R.G. Armstrong--here playing the besotted Sarge--from such genre films as RACE WITH THE DEVIL (1975), CHILDREN OF THE CORN (1984), and the Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle PREDATOR (1987), among others.<br /><br />The DVD from Anchor Bay is well worth the price of admission, featuring the uncut, unrated version of EVILSPEAK for the first time in the US.  The digital transfer is very crisp and clean, offered the film in its original 1.77:1 aspect ratio (enhanced for widescreen TVs) with a clear Dolby 2.0 stereo soundtrack.  Extras include a feature commentary with director Eric Weston and star Clint Howard, as well as the original theatrical trailer.\n",

You have to be careful how long you cook them. This one wasn't bad about that, but it did taste a bit like dirt. I covered it in more sauce than I usually do and it still tasted earthy.

They were a little puzzled at first . . . . The texture of these treats is extremely hard and crunchy and they are in an irregular square shape and have a rather \"handcrafted\" appearance.  The chemical free nature of these and the  hard texture have obvious health benefits.  The taste test? . . . . .<br /><br />In short, after a couple of introductory feedings, my dogs absolutely love these Newman's treats.  They snatch them and immediately retreat to munch and enjoy in private and with gusto.  And I feel like I'm providing a quality wholesome treat.  I'm very happy with this product.\n",

      "First off, lemme say that I've been eating sunflower seeds for over half my life. I've had pretty much every brand & flavor out there. For years I was buying the David variety of seeds because they're the most readily available. You can find them in pretty much any local store. And for the most part, I like the David seeds with one exception...too much salt! Going through a bag a day while at work would make my mouth dry and tore up from all the salt.<br /><br />So I took a chance & ordered a 12 pack of these seeds for a few reasons. First off, they're bacon flavored. What's better than that? NOTHING! Big props to the genius who combined sunflower seeds & bacon. Second, the reviews here are mostly favorable. Third, most of the reviews stated these had much less salt than David seeds. And they're right.<br /><br />I went through a bag of these seeds yesterday and they did not leave my mouth dried up like David seeds. The seeds are larger than average, but I'm not so sure they're bigger than David jumbo seeds. Nevertheless, if you're used to David seeds, get ready for a big change. The flavor of these seeds are pretty good overall, but very different from David seeds. The bacon flavor is somewhat authentic, but I would like to have a bit more of it in these seeds. It just seems a tad too weak in my opinion.<br /><br />Overall, I really like these seeds. The resealable bag is a big plus too. I look forward to trying their other varieties.\n",

I even took a frozen one with me when I went out in the morning on errands and by the time I needed it, it was defrosted and ready to eat.  It has kind of a dense texture that goes better with a coffee or tea, but is fine by itself too.  I usually used them for an on-the-go thing, but especially delicious was warming it up in the toaster oven.  It really felt more like a desserty treat then.  I think the calorie count might be kind of high on this, but for me the ingredients and purpose outweighed that con.  The best thing about this item by far, was the fact that it FILLED ME UP.

      "After my husband [who is a diabetic as well] was diagnosed as gluten intolerant in 2007 I set out on a quest to find someway to eat spaghetti that had some semblance of real spaghetti and still keep his carb count under control.  I discovered spaghetti squash which was a fascinating, if not terribly tasty choice.  Just this past year I gratefully learned about Schar gluten free spaghetti and once we tried it we never looked back.  Although the carb count went out the window, the taste, visual and oral senses took over and we've been thoroughly enjoying the Schar spaghetti since that time.  I can not tell the difference between 'regular' spaghetti and the Schar pasta.  The spaghetti is great buttered but covered in the tastiness of spaghetti sauce, plus my additions, the Schar spaghetti is wonderful.  My husband thinks he has hit the jackpot as he LOVES spaghetti.<br />As far as the carb count goes we have the Schar on special occasions and do not over load his system with the carbs.  It keeps his spirits high to have something special once in a while.<br />BTW- It takes 11 minutes to cook the spaghetti.\n",

They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.\n",

      "I tried some of this on my old guy, an American Staffordshire Terrier that is 14 years, 8 months old. He had just gone through a phase of refusing to eat his normal food, which is good stuff, but is a dry kibble mini disc type ( Bench & Field Holistic - Very good food! )<br />So I got some canned foods to try on him.  Got the Newman's, and 2 other organic kinds.  Buster just loves the canned foods, but the consistency of some of the others is sloppier and harder for him to eat, as they just seem to mash into the bowl, and he has to lick them instead of being able to eat them in soft chunks.  This food smells almost good enough to make me hungry...... and is easy to spoon into his dish, where it takes him less than a nano-second to select a nice chunk and eat it.  I just stand there, and spoon a few chunks at a time into his bowl and he looks for more.<br />So I am really happy with this food and even if he DOES get spoiled on it, he's so worth spoiling at his advanced age that I don't consider it a problem!<br />Before this, I was cooking human food to tempt him just to eat, so this is better balanced and seems to give him more energy.<br />( Before this, he was feed on free schedule, with a bowl of dry food out at all times, and he would eat every 3 days when he felt like it. That worked very well for 14 plus years!  I did the same with my first AmStaff, and he made it to 15. ) Also, Buster has NEVER had to make a vet visit for illness or medical problem his entire life until 2 weeks ago, so that eating arrangement obviously worked great for a very long time!  ; )\n",

I have tried all the other expressos and coffee capsules available. I would not say they were bad or enjoyable, it's just a personal preference and none were falling into my top choices. The Continental was my last option, and to be honest I was not even expecting much since I typically prefer bold coffees and this one was being rated as a smooth one.

      "My older cat, 4 years, got \"hooked\" on Hill's Science Diet Kitten formula when I brought a new kitten, along with a big bag of free S/D, home from the pound. [Prior to that, my well-adjusted cat would eat raw chicken, high quality canned foods, organic kibble--all the \"good stuff\"]<br /><br />Both cats thrived on S/D.  So much so that the kitten grew and grew and grew, into a hefty 9 pounds at 7 months. The 4 year-old cat began ignoring her own food and started eating the kitten's food.  She filled out, also, but to a nice adult weight of 6 pounds.<br /><br />Okay, so 2 months later the kitten is up to 10 pounds and can barely walk without panting.  She cannot stop eating this S/D stuff.  She's enormous, way bigger than her 4 year-old housemate.  I decide to switch back to the healthier food--like Innova Evo, which is 88% meat protein and grain free.  I also augment with superior wet food (the 100% organic, human grade stuff, along with raw chicken, etc).<br /><br />Kitten is okay with that switch--like a tiger she tears away at the raw chicken, gulps at the premium can food--but the older cat doesn't like it, although I do it very gradually over 3 months.  I sit with her, pet her, calm her...Yes, she does eat, just not much--a few kibble crunches, or a tablespoon of wet food.  [Cornell has over 300 studies on anorexic cats].<br /><br />A couple months go by and the kitten is looking better, not panting as much (and  2 pounds lighter) but our 4 year-old cat is now down to 2.9 pounds!  All her ribs show and she has bones where her shoulders are.  She looks like a cheetah that's been deprived of food.  No mater what food I put in front of her--dry, wet, kibble, shredded meat--she will only nibble bits and pieces, here and there.  Her fur has lost its glossy coat.<br /><br />The vet tells me I have to do something, anything, to stop the decline in my cat's health, even if it means feeding the crummy Science Diet Kitten food, Original Formula.<br /><br />I am two days into feeding the cat the S/D Kitten food.  She is wolfing this stuff down as if there's no tomorrow.  It makes me sad that she's become another S/D addict--it's that darn corn filler, converts to sugar and cats love it.  I know, I'd rather have her alive and eating this crud, then wasting to nothing away on more nourishing food.  At least I can console myself that the kitten KNOWS she's a feline and eats like one.\n",

      "I'm a little late to the whole chai game. It seems like I'm the last person to try chai. It was a slow process. A couple of years ago, I was trying to find a brand and flavor of tea that I could really enjoy. I'm not a coffee drinker and always felt left out that I couldn't seem to enjoy a relaxing, warm beverage. I'm a lover of all things coconut and during my tea-buying spree, I found a box of Celestial Seasonings Sweet Coconut Thai Chai and promptly bought it. I also purchased another CS tea called Honey Vanilla Chamomile. I tried the chai once, but since I really didn't know how to prepare chai, I thought it was ok, but didn't go back to it. On the other hand, I immediately fell in love with the Honey Vanilla Chamomile and couldn't live without it. After a while, I was cleaning out my tea cabinet and decided to give away all of the teas I had amassed (except of course for my beloved Honey Vanilla Chamomile) and decided to hang onto the Sweet Coconut Thai Chai just because it was coconut. A few days ago, I decided to try to make it with some warm milk and Sugar in the Raw. I was absolutely blown away! Overnight, I went from zero to Chai fanatic. It seems that if I am a fan of a product, it's a sign that the item will surely be discontinued. Because it had been two years, I was afraid that CS may have stopped producing the Sweet Coconut Thai Chai, and I held my breath as I browsed their website. Thankfully, it is still produced and while on the site, I decided to see what other flavors they make. That's when I saw it--I literally gasped out loud when I saw that Celestial Seasonings makes a Honey Vanilla Chai! Oh my! It couldn't be...my all-time favorite hot tea was also a chai! I rushed out the next day(yesterday) and grabbed up a box and came home to make it. All I can say is WOW! This stuff is amazing! Please, Celestial Seasonings, don't EVER stop making this!\n",

      "The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed \"high-end\" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, potatoes, salmon oil, flax seed, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like \"liver flavor\" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it.\n",

Tastes don't bother me as much as textures do so if you're like me then the grainy/chalky feel of this is going to be too much on it's own. I have to mix it up with the Nutiva brand hemp powder to smooth it out a little and make it stretch (because Nutiva is more expensive) but is the best that I've had so far.<br /><br />This is pretty much what I was expecting though and you have to remember it is a HEALTH shake and it isn't going to taste fantastic but you can do a lot to alter it more to your liking. If I actually used a real blender and added fruit and honey and some things like that to it the graininess could probably be cut down but I'm lazy and don't have time in the mornings to do that and I'm fine with what I do.\n",

      "The Sprout Master is made nicely and looks like it will last a long time. However, it has pin-size holes for drainage, and doesn't seem to work well with small seeds.  I am mostly making broccoli sprouts and alfalfa sprouts (small seeds).  Probably the Sprout Master would work fine with sunflower seeds, nuts, beans, wheat, or other seeds that are at least as large as a mung bean.  What happens with the small seeds, such as the broccoli sprouts, is that they grow their roots through the holes, and their roots make a thick mat underneath.  So then it is very hard to remove the entire sprout.  The roots break off, so then we have only the tops of the sprouts.  I'm able to scrape the roots off of the backside and put them in the salads too, but it's just not as nice as the whole sprout unbroken.  I don't have this problem with my other sprouting system, the Tompson & Morgan Seed Sprouter - Two-tiered (also available at Amazon).  It works so much better because it has slots instead of pinholes.<br /><br />The broccoli sprouts don't make a mat of roots underneath the tray with the Tompson and Morgan Sprouter.  They just make sprouts like you would see in the grocery store.  I've also noticed that my sprouts grow much faster in the Tompson and Morgan Sprouter.  I've done many comparisons, and it always is like this.  I am not sure why.  So, all things said, I wish that I hadn't bought the Sprout Master Triple Sprouter.  I would have bought several more Tompson and Morgan Sprouters instead.  They look very attractive and are a lot easier for me to deal with than the Sprout Master.  I'm sure the Sprout Master is great for people that are using the larger seeds.  Maybe I will start doing some larger seeds/nuts/beans too, but my main interest is with broccoli sprouts, alfalfa sprouts, radishes sprouts, etc., all of which have tiny seeds.<br /><br />The other thing about the Sprout Master, as others have noted, is that it's a bit difficult to clean small seeds out of the holes.  You have to use the tip of a paperclip to poke stuff out sometimes.<br /><br />Once again the Tompson & Morgan is so much easier -- with their slots instead of pin-size holes, the seeds and other stuff fall right out during a quick wash and rinse.  No paperclips and poking needed!<br /><br />And the Tompson & Morgan has gone through my dishwasher many times without harm.  Sprout Master says don't put theirs in dishwasher, so I have not.<br /><br />By the way, if anyone has some ideas for how I can make the Sprout Master work better with my little seeds, I would love to read your comments.  Thanks!\n",

Sometimes I get herbal teas that sound good, but taste nothing like their name would imply - there are so many other stronger herbs in it. But this one tastes just like blackberries. It is slightly tart, but not much. It's a very refreshing tea, both hot and cold. I prefer it with no sugar. Although a bit of sugar seemed to bring out the vanilla flavor a bit more. It does make me wonder though, what are they using for the vanilla taste? The ingredients do not mention vanilla specifically...<br /><br />ingredients:<br />hibiscus flowers, rosehips, sweet blackberry leaves, **natural flavors**, dried black current, pieces, dried blackberry pieces, dried blueberry pieces, dried raspberry pieces, sunflower lecithin<br /><br />I have been hearing that some companies are using something from beaver glands (yes, beaver) to use in food and beverages for vanilla flavoring. Vanilla beans are pricey where as beavers are apparently cheap. And it can be listed as \"natural flavor\" because it is nature-made, not synthetically made in a lab. I would feel much better about drinking this tea if it listed all the ingredients outright and did not use the term \"natural flavors.\" Especially considering the name of the tea includes the word vanilla, yet there is no vanilla listed in the ingredients. For that reason, I can't say I am apt to drink any more of this. While sipping I kept thinking, beaver glands?? Really?? Possibly?? Eww!! I hope that is not the case, but I don't like thinking it could be a possibility. Lipton - if you read this, please verify. I'd love to know I am worrying over nothing.<br /><br />I hope it's more of an over-exaggerated rumor about the common use of beaver glands in food and drink. But still, it does make me get a little grossed out now when I see \"natural flavoring\" in anything with a vanilla taste to it anymore.<br /><br />If the ingredients listed vanilla bean instead of natural flavors, I would give it five stars for it's wonderful blackberry flavor.\n",

      "One reviewer writes that these are Oreo crackers without the creme--and they are right! These thin Oreo crisp wafer type cookies by Nabisco are easy to pack for when you're on the run and just need a quick sugar infusion. They also make for snacking anytime of the day--or night--and they give you that great Oreo taste without actually using creme as an ingredient.<br /><br />These crackers are cholesterol free and trans fat free--hooray!  There are only 100 calories in a serving and a serving contains only two grams of fat. They are baked crackers which helps make them healthier than other snacking choices including greasy French fries. These crackers somehow manage to give you the full Oreo taste experience while omitting the creme and a fair amount of the calories, too. Excellent!<br /><br />These Oreo thin crisps come in six smaller packets which will be inside the box you buy. This makes them even more portable for both children and adults. Another advantage of the cookies coming in smaller packages inside the box is that you know that each packet has been pre-measured to contain only 100 calories. This way you can't accidentally eat too many and take in more calories than you wanted to have.<br /><br />I notice that these crackers are made with cocoa. Please consult your doctor if you have any concerns about caffeine. Chocolate and cocoa could contain too much caffeine for you if you are sensitive to that.<br /><br />I recommend these crackers for persons on the go who want a quick snack. They should provide you with a sugar boost for quick energy. They make for a healthier alternative to other snack foods loaded with fat and/or cholesterol.<br /><br />Buy some and enjoy them today!

      "My star rating is not a reflection on the seller. They were fantastic and quick in processing my order.<br /><br />I am quite fond of rooibos tea from South Africa, which is the only location where GENUINE rooibos tea should come from, FYI. The brand, however, tastes crap. I've gone through about 10 or 12 bags, hoping that it was a fluke. Sadly, it's not. It doesn't taste anything like any rooibos tea I've ever had in my lifetime. In fact, I know this is marketed as the #1 tea company in South Africa. Honestly, though, I had never heard of this brand. Twig and Ouhuis seemed to be pretty popular brands. Of course, most people in SA buy this tea loose.<br /><br />In terms of mass marketing, this would probably be on par with Red Rose brand tea here in the States in terms of quality.<br /><br />I hope this helps!\n",

      "My husband was thrilled when this arrived-- he'd been intending to buy some to try.  However, we were both less than impressed.<br /><br />My husband's an obsessive master of the espresso machine, and despite several attempts, his shots of Red Espresso included almost none of the rich crema pictured in its advertising.<br /><br />We're both espresso and tea drinkers, but this hybrid of the two left us pretty cold.  It's novel to make tea with the espresso machine, I guess, but grassy strong muddy tea isn't my idea of a good drink.  Adding milk and sweetener helps, but it's still not ringing my bells-- or my husband's.  The taste lingers in your mouth, and since we didn't much care for the taste, that's pretty unpleasant.<br /><br />It's pretty expensive, too, at over twenty dollars a pound and about a dollar a serving.  The claims on antioxidants are interesting (5x more than green tea?  really?  according to who?), but there are plenty of foods we actually like with antioxidants in them-- I think we'll pass on this one.  I'd rather drink five glasses of the Republic of Tea's orange spice green tea than choke down a shot (or sweetened latte) of this stuff.<br /><br />Bleugh.\n",

      "This review is for <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041R1UM0\">Wissotzky Red Tea with Chamomile, Lime & Honey, 1.41-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> There are other flavors I like very much that I refer to at the bottom of this review. These are all non-caffeine, high antioxidant herbal teas that are always startling delicious to anyone I have served them too.<br /><br />Wissotzky makes a whole range of teas, including those with black tea and those with green tea. The ones I discuss here are my personal favorites.<br /><br />Wissotzky Teas are rather renowned though, personally, I hadn't heard of them until I was teaching at my University's summer law program at University of Haifa in Israel. You pick them up at any supermarket there -- but you have to special order them over here in the US.<br /><br />Having to live in dormitory-style living while teaching over there, the tea was convenient but I was most startled by how really delicious it was. I am not a big tea drinker -- occasionally herbal tea in the winter -- but I was drinking this tea every day during the very hot Israeli summer.<br /><br />I brought quite a bit back with me and ordered more here. I often offered it to colleagues during meetings in my office and they were invariably struck by how unexpectedly delicious it is.<br /><br />So now I give boxes as gifts. And the recipients often hint they wouldn't mind another gift they so love it.<br /><br />Serving the tea at one of my group work meetings has become a hallmark tradition and puts a positive tone as we launch into a 3 hour work session.<br /><br />For more information:<br />These herbal teas are made from the Rooibus (Red Bush) plant from South Africa.<br /><br />The only authentic Rooibus tea is from South Africa -- though many companies claim theirs is Rooibus though not from South Africa.<br /><br />It is not unlike that genuine Champagne can only come from the Champagne region of France but firms market sparkling wines from other regions prepared by the \"Methode Champenoise.\" In that case, there are excellent Methode Champenoise sparkling wines that rival genuine Champagne (though being a champagne lover -- I still find a taste unique to genuine Champagne.)<br /><br />However my experience is that non-South African Rooibus Tea is not as good nor does it have the medicinal and homeopathic qualities that genuine Rooibus tea does.<br /><br />As to the variations: Wissotzky sells the pure Rooibus Tea (which does not seem to be here on Amazon) and 3 flavored versions: 1. with Chamomile, Lime & Honey,[[B0041R1UM0 Wissotzky Red Tea with Chamomile, Lime & Honey, 1.41-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)]] (my and most people's favorite)  2. with Cinnamon & Vanilla <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041R00WG\">Wissotzky Red Tea with Cinnamon and Vanilla, 1.41-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>(my second most favorite and many people's first choice) and 3. with Rosehip & Passion Fruit <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041R1DYA\">Wissotzky Red Tea with Rosehip and Passion fruit, 1.41-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> (which I also really like and again is some people's favorites.)<br /><br />As mentioned at the start of this review -- Wissotzky makes a whole range of teas, both with and without flavors, herbal, black tea and green tea (which has its own homeopathic benefits.) I've tried many of the other herbal and enjoy them; I personally stay away from caffeine as my system doesn't handle it well.\n",

He'd rather eat regular dog food than this which is quite weird for him.  He eats everything he can get his paws on, including non edible stuff. It might be because the smell is not very strong.  When I put it up close to my nose to smell it, I barely got a light whiff of salmon. Dog treats usually have a stronger smell which makes it more tempting for dogs.\n",

      "I've been on the hunt for high quality cat food that doesn't cost a fortune. After a lot of research at various sites Petguard was one on my list to try, so I ordered a case from amazon and couldn't be happier. 2/3 of my cats LOVE it, the 3rd cat is a dry food addict and I'm in the process of trying to convert her but it's slow going. Be warned though, this stuff smells terrible, opening a can and dishing it out is like being slapped in the face with a week old mackerel, but that's how cats like it.<br /><br />Bottom line this food is reasonably priced and high quality. It has low carbs, low ash/magnesium, high protein, real human grade meat with no by-products, the vitamins/minerals are chelated for better absorption and Petguard has stated they do not use BPA lined cans. Also, contrary to what the ingredient list here on Amazon says it does NOT contain \"Menadione Sodium Bisulfite\" or at least the case I ordered doesn't have any listed, so they must have stopped using it, which is a big plus.\n",

I am actually quite surprised it doesn't have chicory in it. It is bold and rich without being at all bitter. Prior to this coffee, I thought Starbuck's Italian roast was the boldest commercial blend. But, Double Black Diamond makes it look weak in comparison. It brews to an almost jet-black and is very dark and earthy without a hint of bitterness or sweetness. It is very much like an espresso and I suspect it may contain as much caffeine.

I left a msg for Canidae about 20 mins ago, and they already called me back at work to answer my questions (unlike Blue during the food scare).  If you have seen a blog concerning something about Acetaminophen being in Canidae, that is false. Some lady said she had Canidae and some other foods tested by putting them in a baggie together...blah blah, any way it was a false allegation but the internet spreads rumors like wildfire.

      "We love PG Tips and were worried that when we moved to the US that we wouldn't be able to find a cost effective way of getting our teabags.  We use on average 6-8 teabags a day so we really couldn't afford to buy an 80 count box from World Market at $7-9 a piece.  We were thrilled when Amazon started carrying the 2 pack of 240 count boxes with free shipping.<br /><br />So imagine how irritated I was to come back to re-order more teabags (after ordering the same thing from Amazon for over 2 years) to find that they no longer carry that size and that they have pawned off the same exact 2 pack to another company who wants to charge me almost $6 for shipping.  (The new company even have the Amazon \"2 pack\" symbol on their image which means that Amazon has probably got this company doing fulfillment now.) Shame on Amazon.com - what's the purpose of free shipping or my prime account if you've got someone else selling your product that's going to charge me shipping?<br /><br />So I've had to go with the 160 count pack of 4, but I wouldn't preferred to just order my usual so I don't have open bags going stale.<br /><br />A small rant, I know, but I look for Amazon to be dependable when every other online retailer is not.  Please bring back my 2 pack of 240 count...\n",

I guess someone at Nabisco thought it made sense to repackage these graham crackers into smaller portions, but with all of the \"100 calorie snack packs\" that abound today I think Nabisco missed the mark here.  Each \"stack\" of these crackers is actually nearly two servings, which contain about 250 calories total.  The box itself gives the nutritional information for a full stack (7 squares) as well as for 4 squares, so it seems like Nabisco is acknowledging that the full stack is more than one should eat at one sitting.  I'm not sure why they packaged these crackers in this manner, then, since the crackers would stay more fresh if each individually wrapped packet contained only one serving.<br /><br />As for the product itself, I quite like graham crackers and enjoy these, but I prefer the kind with a cinnamon and sugar coating versus these more plain, honey graham crackers.<br /><br />Good with cold milk!\n",

      "Fiji water is noticeably an excellent quality water.  I've been drinking water for over 21 years, ever since I was a child. So as you can see I have tons of experience with water.  My family tells an old story of how when I was a young man infatuated with water that I almost drowned myself trying to drink 3 glasses of water at one time, using a series of straws!  Needless to say, I consider water an expertise of mine.<br /><br />I conducted a 3 week study of FIJI water. I used FIJI for almost everything, excluding bathing because of the obvious expense.  I cooked pasta with FIJI water, I washed my face every now and then with FIJI water, I diluted my liquid soap with FIJI water, and I drank exclusively FIJI water.  What I noticed over these 3 weeks will shock you!<br /><br />Week 1.  My toe and finger nails grew much faster than usual, with a nice shine to them.  I also noticed a loss in body fat.<br />Week 2.  My nails continued to grow and I noticed noticeably thicker leg hair.<br />Week 3.  The improvements continue to increase, my current nail length is approximately 3/4 of an inch.  I had to trim my leg hair because it was getting out of control.<br /><br />I will not buy FIJI again, but only because I do not necessarily want thicker leg hair.<br />I do recommend this product though!\n",

When I ordered it, I thought I was getting something you could just give the dog, and she would entertain herself for a long time, by licking. It sounded like a good idea because my dog really likes to lick things. I give her something lick-able when I want her to go lay down and be quiet. This product is useless for that purpose. This is an interactive treat. You and your dog both have to interact with it. It gets old, pretty much immediately.<br /><br />The product itself is gross. It's sticky and unappealing. The smell is nauseating. My dog would take a sniff, and sometimes a trial lick, and then just walk away. I'd be left standing there holding a phallic shaped bottle of mysterious smelly goo.<br /><br />Here are some things my dog likes better than Lickety Stiks: dirty diapers, dead pigeons, week-old garbage, and other dog's butts.<br /><br />The only people who really enjoyed the product are the teenagers in my house, who think \"Lickety Stik\" is possibly the most hilarious product name they ever heard. The jokes lasted most of the afternoon. The packaging offers plenty of crude suggestions (\"give a lick\" tm  they trademarked that??), as if my kids needed any encouragement. Even the shape of the bottle - a rigid cylinder with a ball on top - was fodder for hilarity. They thought it was just so funny.<br /><br />So this is a stupid product with a funny name and a suggestive shape, which solves no problems, has no appeal beyond comedy, and is completely worthless.\n",

      "This whole wheat bread by Arnold is excellent! It's healthy for you with its whole grain. While the top crust is somewhat firm, the bread itself and the rest of the crust are pretty soft and tasty when you eat this bread before the expiration date.<br /><br />As of this time this whole wheat/whole grain bread is rather expensive on this website; I suppose that's the premium anyone has to pay if they want the convenience of having these loafs of bread shipped directly to their front door. People like me who want a better price should keep looking especially at brick and mortar stores like supermarkets where this bread should be readily available.<br /><br />I highly recommend this whole wheat/whole grain bread by Arnold; it's healthy and one of the best tasting breads out there!\n",

      "These tortilla chips have an \"all-natural\" feel to them, and a somewhat unique taste, which is both good and bad.<br /><br />First off, I'll just comment on the packaging.  The singular bag is made of a relatively thick foil-like material and is air puffed tightly.  The result is freshly crisp, unbroken chips in the bag.  A nice bonus and much better than standard lunch-sized chip bags you find from most common companies.<br /><br />As for the taste of the chips, they're pretty good.  I liked the olive and garlic flavor when I was eating them by themselves.  However, when I paired them with some salsa, the olive taste didn't match up that well.  They might go better with a french onion chip dip instead (though I didn't try that).<br /><br />So if you want fresh, never-broken tortilla chips to eat just by themselves with no dip, these do rather well.  If you're looking for a chip to go with your bowl of salsa, you may want go elsewhere.\n",

      "Well, maybe not &quot;the&quot; greatest, but one of the best.  This set brings together the earlier stuff which is slightly more quirky than the two albums they did for Virgin.  Some of it is even sort of challenging, but mixed in are some songs as lovable as a soft fluffy kitten with a ball of yarn like &quot;Take the Skinheads Bowling&quot; and &quot;Good Guys &amp; Bad Guys&quot;.  There was this one story about them one time when they played in Philly and stayed with the Dead Milkmen for the night.  It's a great story, but probably shouldn't be repeated here.  When I first picked up a guitar (actually the first time I picked up a guitar after hearing the third album) I wanted to play &quot;Good Guys &amp; Bad Guys&quot; but I was the only keyboard player in the band so I got stuck playing the keyboard part which is a lot more tasty after you play it a few times.  We can thank our lucky stars that these guys are touring again.  I was heartbroken when they broke up and Cracker always sounded a little too sanitized.  This set is almost like another album coming out, except that the songs came out before.  It's beautiful.\n",

      "5-hour tasted fine and I felt somewhat \"energized\" as I hoped. But, 5-hour, like all of these energy drinks (Monster, RockStar, RedBull, Cocaine etc.) is obscenely overpriced liquid caffeine. As of 2008, there have been no large scale, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over clinical trials that show the ingredients, other than caffeine, in these \"proprietary blends\" actually work in healthy humans as advertised. When pressed, the manufacturers cannot come up with the data that support their hype. To date, only good ol' caffeine is the only over-the-counter drug that does what people who buy these overpriced snake-oils desire. So, save your money. Buy ANY drink you like and just pop a 200mg caffeine pill like max strength NoDoz or Vivarin. Cheers.\n",

      "I am very surprised that I felt the way I did after trying one of these 5 hour energy drinks.  I did not think there was that much caffeine in each one but apparently there is because I had the jitter attacks bi-time which started about ten minutes after I finished the bottle.  I got the sick feeling and it did not go away for, well about 5 hours actually.  I was very close to putting my finger down my throat to try to throw it up thinking maybe that would make me feel better, although I'm a pretty big wimp so I didn't do that.<br /><br />I am not overly sensitive to caffeine but while the 5-hour energy drink obviously works for some people, it did not work for me.  I tried green tea capsules about a week later (yes I was on the hunt for a good energy booster) and I have not had one negative experience to report.  I also recommend raspberry ketones which I take with the green tea, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008HYRW6G\">Green Tea Extract 60 Capsules (500mg) + FREE 25 Grams Raspberry Ketones Powder</a>.  I think I found a good combination for me, finally.<br /><br />The only reason I need to take something for energy is because I start work at 5am everyday, which means I get up at 3:45am!  I try to stay away from coffee and based on my own experience and research green tea extract is the most natural and effective energy booster I know of that I can take without any side effects.  Hope this helps someone!\n",

Bella and Dora, our adopted kittens, were suffering from a respitory cold that they had picked up from the shelter and were not eating any food.<br /><br />The girl at the shop was really cool and introduced us to the Weruva line of food as well as other brands. I was interested to find out that the owners of Weruva are somehow related to the company that produces all the tuna for Subway Sandwiches. I guess the husband/wife team had cats and were dissapointed to find low quality soft food in the market, and asked to find out what it would take to be able to use the same facilities. They found out that as long as they produced human grade food, they could use the facility. Anyways, we bought a whole bunch of flavors to see what they would like, and ultimately this is the only one that they always finish!<br /><br />I like that you can tell that it is fish, and not some mushed up by product.

Note - no High Fructose Corn Syrup here.  The other two ingredients aren't what you'd typically put in for yourself, potassium bicarbonate and potassium citrate, often added to drinks to regulate acidity.<br /><br />The taste is pretty good for a canned product - nice strong coffee flavor, the way I like it. Perhaps a bit more sugar than I would normally use, but less than I find in most commercial drinks. There is a hint of chemical in the taste, but it isn't obnoxious. I found it quite refreshing. One can is 50 calories, about 2/3 what you'd find in the equivalent amount of soda.  Caffeine content is 155mg per can, about on par for brewed coffee and maybe twice what a typical can of an \"energy drink\" contains.\n",

      "I'm a big fan of smokey foods, so I was eager to try smoked salt, hoping it would add complexity and intrigue to food that isn't, itself, smoked.  When I opened the pack and a lovely, subtle wave of smokey scent rose up, I was optimistic.  Sadly, the salt itself does not actually taste that smokey.  I have tried it along with olive oil as an accent on ciabatta, and on vegetables, and in soup. If the smoke taste was even there, it was essentially overwhelmed by anything else in the same mouthful.  Even bread.  Desperate for smokiness, I even tried a few grains directly on my tongue.  Too subtle for me -- that smokey punch just wasn't there.<br /><br />Still, the salt itself is Maldon, which is lovely. And it smells terrific.  If your tastebuds are more discerning than mine (and they very well may be), you might find the degree of smokiness to your taste.  Me, I'm still looking for my Perfect Smoked Salt.\n",

      "This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.\n",

      "I drink a lot of iced tea but not if it isn't sweet.  I thought these individual packets would be good for adding to my tea and I'm glad to have something that won't spike my insulin levels.  One packet is worth about two sugar packets so be careful how much you use.  I think sugar tastes good, aspartame tastes good, sucralose (e.g. Splenda) tastes good, saccharin tastes good (when you don't overdo it) but this was just weird.  It was sweet for sure, but it seems like most of the sweetness didn't register until a few seconds later.  I also registered an almost bitter taste, but just for a split second with each sip.  It's really hard for me to explain, but I'll just say I had no desire to finish the rest of my iced tea.<br /><br />I tried it again later and did a few experiments with it.  First, I poured a little on my finger and tasted it by itself.  Again I thought it had kind of an odd taste and slightly bitter.  I poured a slightly larger portion on my finger and tasted that.  Yuck!  Maybe it's like that because it's sweeter than sugar, but I got the same sensation when I mixed it in my tea.  I also tried adding it gradually to my tea and the best I could do was a neutral flavor.  Once it started to get sweet I could taste that same funny and slightly bitter taste.  Another wasted glass.<br /><br />This is the first stevia product I've tried so I can't say the sweetener itself tastes like this, they do add other ingredients.  If you want to try this product you really need to get the cheapest/smallest that you can.  I'll be throwing out about 95% of this stuff and I'm regretting that I ever used 5% of it.<br /><br />I would, however, recommend agave nectar.  It's a low-calorie sweetener with a low glycemic index and it's natural (usually organic).  It has a smooth taste, a pleasant aftertaste [if any], and even when I use too much it doesn't taste terrible.  I've tried two different brands and I have yet to be disappointed.\n",

      "I enjoy trying new flavors, especially sauces and sandwich dressings.  I once inadvertently discovered that a certain flavor of a certain brand of salad dressing is pure heaven on a roast beef sandwich, and now I won't eat roast beef without it.<br /><br />When I saw that Taco Bell had come out with a new line of sandwich dressings, I figured it couldn't hurt to try.  As an Amazon Vine customer, I was able to get two free bottles, so I chose Taco Bell Bold & Creamy Chipotle sauce and Bold & Creamy Jalape&ntilde;o sauce.  The idea of trying them on a sandwich made my mouth water.<br /><br />I had a guest who wanted to try the Chipotle sauce.  OK by me; I figured I'd keep the Jalape&ntilde;o for myself.  He took one bite, on a ham and cheese sandwich, and pronounced it, \"Flavored mayonnaise\".  I remember thinking it couldn't be that bad, but it didn't bode well that he didn't finish the sandwich.<br /><br />A week or so later, I got some take-out chicken fingers and figured they'd be good to try the sauce with.  Since the Chipotle was already opened, I poured some on a plate used it to dip my chicken fingers in.  I dipped it in.  I tried one, two, three chicken fingers.  My friend was wrong.  It didn't taste like flavored mayonnaise.  It tasted like generic, store brand flavored mayonnaise.  Like real Chipotle, it had a mildly smoky, bacon flavor.  But beyond cheap - it was very, very cheap tasting.<br /><br />This brings us to today.  I had a friend over, and I made some frozen chicken (General Taos's Chicken, if you must know).  As the chicken was frozen and rather bland, I figured it was time to try the Jalape&ntilde;o sauce.  I put some out in a dish and we tried it, dipping our chicken into it.  Yecch!  This time, it tasted like generic, Jalape&ntilde;o flavored store brand flavored mayonnaise.  It wasn't very spicy, as I would expect Jalape&ntilde;o to be.  It also wasn't terribly flavorful and, on the whole, it reminded me of the Chipotle sauce, just a little more spicy and maybe a little more boring and cheap tasting.  I wanted to be as fair as possible, so I gamely continued on for another few pieces.  When I realized it had ruined my dinner and I'd had enough, I'd had enough.<br /><br />Shortly before starting this review, I dumped the two half-empty bottles of sauce into my garbage can.  From now on, when I think of sandwich sauces, well, \"Yo no quiero Taco Bell\".<br /><br />Not recommended.\n",

(In fact, I even signed up for subscribe and save) When my package arrived today, the bag says they only have 1 gram of fiber per serving! I called Garden of Eatin' and was told that there was new analysis and testing done which shows they only actually have one gram of fiber per serving. That's a huge difference! The customer service rep said the testing was done in September, yet the nutrition information on their own website still shows 4 grams of fiber. To me, that is false advertising.

I enjoyed the taste and if you have the extra money and want a healthier alternative, you might want to give it a try, but it is still 140 calories per can.  So it isn't exactly a diet drink.

      "I am so disappointed with this coffee that I'll be requesting a refund after I type this review. I bought into the hype of Intelligentsia coffee and had to try it. Hip packaging with an even hipper name - Black Cat. Loved the fact that it was organic too. Even bought a great burr mill grinder. I was ready for some deliciously dark, rich espresso! As soon as I opened the bag and smelled the beans, my heart sunk. No espresso aroma here - not even dark or french roast. I would compare it to the same smell as Dunkin Donuts coffee - fine if that's what you're expecting and you've paid half of what I spent on this Black Cat. The beans were dried out without any of that lovely oiliness and they certainly weren't black or dark color but reddish brown - the color of a hazlenut to be exact. I hoped the ground beans would magically transform into expresso while brewing. Hah! Not a chance. Instead of espresso, I settled for an over-rated, expensive cup of common tasting coffee and never bothered to grind any more of those beans. If you expect oily, black beans and love rich, dark coffee - try Kicking Horse - available from Amazon. It's the best coffee I've ever tasted. It won't disappoint!\n",

      "Purchased my traps at Lowes and the moths flocked to them.  After a month or two I couldn't tell if the traps were still working - they had collected many moths!  So I moved the old traps to a different closet and added two more traps to the pantry.  all four traps are still catching moths!<br /><br />So, the traps (a) lure the moths and trap them, but (b) I'm still having moths show up over three months later.  I suspect the moths have dug in quite well, but I'll continue adding traps until they come up clean.<br /><br />I realize that some reviewers say the traps don't work...I wonder if they opened the small envelope (~1\"x1\") that contained the pheromone chip, and placed (dropped) the chip onto the sticky board as the instructions directed.  That chip is what draws the males to the sticky board.  Without the pheromone chip, the trap will be ineffective.<br /><br />When I first opened the trap I found the instructions to be not as clear as I thought they should have been - I wasn't certain how the pheromone chip was to be placed in the trap.  It turns out that you just open the envelope (pouch?) and drop the chip onto the sticky board on the inside of the trap.  then place the trap in the location where you believe the moths reside.  The trap does the rest - safely.<br /><br />I'm satisfied with the operation of the trap, but ready for the moths to be eradicated.  At least they are no longer flying around my kitchen!\n",

Unfortunately, the ingredients did not mention that there are RAISINS in this product. The combination of apples, raisins and cinnamon is not a good idea at all. My baby actually started gagging when I put a spoonful in her mouth. When I tasted it myself, I felt like doing the same. This mixture is just too sweet because of the raisins. There is also a very strong flavor of cinnamon. I usually add some cinnamon to the food she eats so I know that she likes cinnamon if its in a normal quantity. I tried diluting the flavor in several ways, but it's no use. The cinnamon flavor was still too strong. I still have about 8 more jars to experiment with. I'm thinking I'll give it one more try by mixing apple puree with a little bit of this mixture and see if the baby will take it or not. Otherwise, it's all going in the trash. I hate wasting food but there doesn't seem to be another option.\n",

I am very particular about what I give my dogs: dog of 10yrs died/cancer and had 2 knee replacements due to arthritis/joint issues. My Dogs are doing great on Canidae. I just spoke w/ Canidae less than 2 mins ago and they HAVE NOT changed their product at all. I read the review from the person that once gave this product a great review and now thinks the product has changed due to her dogs' digestive issues (or something like that).  I left a msg for Canidae about 20 mins ago, and they already called me back at work to answer my questions (unlike Blue during the food scare).  If you have seen a blog concerning something about Acetaminophen being in Canidae, that is false. Some lady said she had Canidae and some other foods tested by putting them in a baggie together...blah blah, any way it was a false allegation but the internet spreads rumors like wildfire. I drive 2 hrs to re-stock on Canidae. Highly recommend.\n",

All three of my dogs (two cocker spaniels and a jack russell terrier)seemed to think that they smelled great, so who am I to judge.  I am careful about the treats that they get because the cocker spaniels try to inhale most of them.  These actually took them a while to annihilate.  Some treats leave a sticky residue on them and the carpet, but these weren't messy.  Although they smelled funky, the smell didn't linger on their breath.  The size was excellent for my dogs.  A lot of treats that are recommended for their size tend to be much smaller.  Six came in the pack, so I waited a while before giving them the second round.  They are a bit too expensive for me to buy regularly.  If they ever go on sale I would probably stock up.  Overall a pretty good product.\n",

      "QUICK SUMMARY:  This highly fudgey cookie is addictive and was gobbled up at a party in no time.  However, the cookies themselves are relatively small (just slightly larger than a Thin Mint or Oreo in diameter), and I/we did note a chemical taste not unlike that found in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002OXIZOE\">Chips Ahoy Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies</a>.  You'll go through a package quickly both because of the deliciousness and that you really only get 15-18 relatively small cookies.  More details follow...<br /><br />PACKAGING:<br />(Note - I received this product through the Vine program and it is possible that packaging will change between the review version and final launch.)<br />The outer wrap is a relatively standard Chips Ahoy pack.  Opening it involves lifting a tab on the front, which reveals three rows of cookies.  While the cookies in my package were intact, I was initially shocked by how much air is in the package.  Nabisco clearly re-used the tray from other cookie products, and these cookies do not fill the space.  As such, they're probably prone to bounce around and crumble if treated poorly in shipment.  The package can be re-sealed by pressing the flap back down and running a finger along the edge to adhere.  The cookies didn't last long enough for me to judge whether the package truly prevents the cookies from becoming stale.  The seal seems a little looser than I'd like.<br /><br />VISUAL IMPRESSION:<br />The cookies look kind of shabby, to be honest.  They don't look like they'd be very chocolaty.  Also, the smaller size is quite striking if you're used to the size of a standard Chips Ahoy.  (This smaller size likely accounts for the large amount of airspace in the packaging.)<br /><br />FLAVOR:<br />I was blown away by the taste of these.  While there is a slight chemical taste, it is the same chemical taste found in any soft-style packaged cookie.  The chemical taste is quickly replaced by an explosion of chocolate.  One guest I shared these with noted that the cookie tasted a S'more minus the marshmallow. (Idea for Nabisco: S'more flavor!)  I was initially concerned that the cookie would be too sweet, but the chocolate filling is kind of dark and semi-sweet which compliments the cookie perfectly.  The cookies are also quite rich, and I found myself satisfied after a smaller quantity of cookies than normal.<br /><br />NUTRITION:<br />Well, it's a cookie.  You shouldn't be expecting a health food here.  It's 150 calories per serving, and a serving is roughly 2 cookies.  That seems fairly calorie-dense to me, but your perception may vary. Each serving has 21g of carbs, with 13g of those coming from sugar.  There's no trans-fats, and the ingredients list sugar, not HFCS, as the main sweetening ingredient.<br /><br />QUANTITY/VALUE:<br />At $4.32 a package, that's roughly 24-28 cents a cookie or around 50-56 cents a serving (2 cookies).  While I didn't pay for this product directly, I have to say that I would not pay over $4 per package for these given the low quantity of cookies.  I'd watch for a sale or lower price.\n",

      "This tea is naturally decaffeinated without the use of chemical solvents.<br /><br />It also has added white tea, which the box says is for a smoother taste. White tea is loaded with powerful anti-oxidants (much more so than green tea). So, I considered it a bonus to be able to have both in one cup. This does affect the flavor, though. There isn't a lot of depth to this green tea, which I believe the other reviewers have alluded to.<br /><br />Each box of 40 comes shrink wrapped. Inside the box, there is a pouch with 40 tea bags. They are not individually wrapped, and they do not have the string/tag most tea bags have. They are in pairs, so if you like your tea strong, just use two at a time. Otherwise, you'll need to separate them. The label states they have saved lots of trees by not using extra packaging. I think it's great, so long as you drink the tea in a timely manner. Otherwise, you might want to consider keeping the tea in an air-tight container to maintain freshness.\n",

      "I bought this product as an alternative to other diet sodas (the \"big two\" will remain nameless) mainly because I wanted to get away from the aspartame artificial sweetener. I've heard \"bad things\" about aspartame but after doing my own research on it I couldn't find any conclusive research or studies proving it was as bad as people claimed. There are tons of sites that say all these bad things it does to you, but nobody can give me a single study proving any of what they say. I tend to think this thing against aspartame is more of a conspiracy then anything else.<br /><br />But regardless, I decided to lower my intake of aspartame and try this Zevia, since it's sweetened with Stevia. The taste is certainly lacking and while it doesn't taste horrible, when comparing it to the major players in the industry - it stinks. A very bland taste and there is very little carbonation.<br /><br />Did I mention it gave me horrible gas and bloating? You know the kind that sits with you all day long and just gives you an unsettled stomach? The reason for this is that it has a sugar alcohol in it called \"erythritol\" and if you know anything about sugar alcohols, they almost always give you an upset stomach, gas, and/bloating. Sugar alcohols are what those sugar free, low carb chocolates have in them. And while wikipedia states that this sugar alcohol \"shouldn't\" be as bad as the other more notorious ones, like xylitol, because none of it \"supposedly\" reaches the large intestine...let's just say I would disagree.<br /><br />If aspartame is so bad for you then why is that these products sweetened with stevia cause discomfort in some people? You'd think the \"bad\" product would be the one where you actually notice the side effects. At $1 a can (compare that to less then 30 cents a can for other cola brands), coupled with the potential unwanted discomfort, I think you might wanna stay away from this product.\n",

      "All four of my cats loved this canned cat food!  The food in each can really looked and smelled as if a human being could eat the food.<br /><br />The seasame chicken entree and chicken pot pie entree were both very popular with my cats.  Neither flavor smelled bad.  The chicken pot pie entree was kind of runny, but my cats really enjoyed lapping up the juice.  I've feed my cats a few cans of each flavor, and none of them have got the diarrhea from the food.  Their stomachs seem to tolerate the food quite well.  I've had probelms in the past with canned cat food causing stomach and other digestive problems for my cats.<br /><br />According to the can's list of ingredients, all the ingredients are natural - no by-products are used.  While the food is not organic, at least the food doesn't use by-products.  No wheat gluten is used either.<br />I went to the company's website and found that the company uses only dolphin safe tuna and does not use any child labor.  None of the ingredients come from China, which has a horrible record on food safety.  The cat food is made in  Thailand, but as far as I know, Thailand does not have a poor record of food safety, and Thai people do love their pet cats, I sure Thai pet owners would not want to harm their cats with poor quality pet food.  I personally see nothing to fear from Thai cat food.<br /><br />I think I will be ordering more Petite Cusine in the future and would not hestitate recommending this food to my cat loving friends.\n",

      "I normally get this tea at Teavana stores in the mall or their website, so was excited to see it on Amazon (as I have tons of gift cards here). It seemed to take a little longer then other products to arrive but came in great shape and came with a free sample just like my other orders from the Teavana site have (which makes sense since they're partnered with Amazon). I drink the White Ayurvedic Chai with the  Samurai Chai Mate and they taste fantastic together. They're supposed to be full of caffeine but for me they're my anytime tea. I have to steep a little longer then recommended time as I like my tea strong (with a bit of sugar or honey :) but it tastes great. Not to sickly sweet like some fruity teas.<br />It is sweeter then some of their other teas, so if you don't like sweet then you may want to try out some of their others. I recommend going into the stores and sampling their array of teas they usually have set out to find your favorite. The blend they normally have of this one is good but not always what comes out at home though so don't just go by that one. They use German rock sugar (which they sell) and that costs a little more. Most people will use normal table sugar, honey, or artificial sweetener which will affect the tastes. Anyway, go try the tea, find your tea and drink happy.\n",

I decided to try this powdered goats milk because I remembered that my parents told me that I was allergic to cows milk when I was a baby and they gave me goats milk instead, but then switched me to cows milk when I was old enough to tolerate it.  I wish they had left me on the goats milk growing up because I find that my body tolerates it much better, and I think I would have been healthier as a child growing up if I'd had goats milk instead of cows milk.<br /><br />I use it to make my own kefir, yogurt, custards and whatever else I need milk for.  I was a bit dubious when I first bought it....I didn't know if I would like the taste of it or not, but....I love the taste and the smell of it.  Mmmmmm.....Yum. The taste at first reminded me a tiny bit of the flavor of lamb.....and I love lamb....but this taste is so slight that it's not noticable in kefir (which makes the most delicious pancakes), or yogurt or in custard or any other baked goods.  I like the taste and smell of this goats milk better than cows milk.<br /><br />I also like the powdered milk because I can make it up a cup at a time or a quart at a time, as I need it, and never have to worry about having to store it in the refrigerator or it going bad or spoiling.  It's very convenient.<br /><br />It takes a few minutes for it to dissolve and be absorbed into warm water when first mixing it, but once it is all dissolved in the water, I can't tell the difference between this powdered milk and fresh milk.

      "While you read this review, please keep in mind that I'm not a huge granola/trail mix/nut type fan at all. Nuts only appeal to me if they are super salty. I'll only snack on trail-mix if it's got a lot of M&Ms. I'll eat a granola bar, but only if it's got enough junk food in it to render it a mislabeled candy bar. It's just never appealed to me even though I'm an extremely healthy eater.<br /><br />However, \"Chocolate Delight\" is satisfying to me. It's basically like a crumbly, crunchy lightly-sweet oatmeal cookie with small chunks of chocolate laced throughout. I didn't find it sweet OR salty, to be honest- it's just lightly sweet which makes it snackable. The chocolate isn't bitter, nor is it overly sweet- it's just the right compliment for the granola. I also like that the chocolate doesn't leave a weird aftertaste in my mouth like a lot of other dark chocolates do. There's not a whole lot of chocolate, just enough to provide a nice \"kick\" to the granola.<br /><br />It's definitely a satisfying snack because it's got some bulk to it- if you eat it by the handful, you won't feel like you've just crunched on baked air, like a lot of other healthy snacks. It feels like you've actually eaten something satisfying.<br /><br />My husband, who IS a fan of granola, said he would have preferred it without the chocolate. I probably wouldn't *eat* it if it didn't have the chocolate, so your milage may vary on that one.<br /><br />By the way- this *isn't* a cereal, as another reviewer noted - it's meant to be eaten as a snack. I'm actually anxious to try it out with my daughter when she gets home from school. She's three and an EXTREMELY picky eater. I'm hoping this might be something she can snack on instead of cereal and chips. I think the chocolate will be a huge draw for her and I can feed it to her without worrying about all the salt and sugar she's getting.\n",

      "Other than orange juice in the morning I pretty much don't drink anything except water.  I received a 1.5 liter bottle to try of this purified water.  I think \"purified\" in the name says something.<br />The bottle says that they have \"proprietary technology\" which has purified the water by reverse osmosis then infused it with electrolytes for taste, alkalized and restructured it using ionic separation technology.  Okay, we will take their word for it, but none of that sounds any different from any other reverse osmosis to me and adding the \"electrolytes\" is what changes the pH of the water to make it alkalized and restructured, if I remember my chemistry correctly.  The ingredients are listed as purified water, sodium bicarbonate dipotassium phosphate magnesium sulfate and calcium chloride.  The bottle never gives a source but you can find Bothell WA, so most likely it comes from the public water supply there.<br /><br />More bottle information - Doctor recommended to protect improve and enhance the quality of your health.  Silky smooth taste, infused with electrolytes for a difference you can taste 9.5 pH.  I have been told by my doctor to drink at least 2 liters of water daily.  I am a distance walker and live in a hot dry area of the country so any outside work or exercise requires a replacement of fluids and most likely electrolytes.  I don't like sports drinks.  So water with electrolytes is perfect for me.<br /><br />This water did taste good.  It was smooth.  I am just not sure that I want to drink water from a public water source when I can get water from a spring, drop in an electrolyte tablet and have the same thing.  So while I can't argue with any of the claims made on the bottle, I am not convinced enough that this is a \"can't live without it\" purchase.\n",

I've tried making it differently, I tried to let it rise and then start the bread machine and it still doesn't work. In fact, that time it fell kind of flat. I am discouraged and saddened that I spent a lot of money for this bread and it doesn't turn out like a regular loaf. I don't want to bake it in the oven, I wanted to use my bread machine ;(<br />I wish that on the description for this bread that they would tell you that it doesn't work well with a bread machine. Once the product is opened you cannot return it. Good luck, I hope you have better luck then me we're on our 3rd loaf and it still doesn't look or taste like bread that you can use for a sandwich, it tastes more like a dessert type of bread.\n",

The dispenser contains over 500 licks.  A no mess way to give rewards plus it carries the made in the USA with all-natural ingredients.  My English Bulldog puppy loves the stuff (liver flavor); however, it also comes in chicken and bacon flavors. Following  is a list for those who read the ingredients,  1)natural liver flavors, (2) cultured milk, (3) lecithin, (4) mixed tocopherols (natural preservative- a source of vitamin E), (5) scorbyl palmitate (source of vitamin C), (6) rosemary extract, (7) green tea extract.  A caution about dogs allergic to chicken - they should not be licking this stuff. Unlike most treats, the shelf life is 18 months and \"best\" licked by date is stamped on the bottom of the roll-on dispenser. The description indicates the Lickety Stik formula contains antimicrobial agents - basically no germ transfer. The stuff does not have to be refrigerated.  Naturally, you must shake the dispenser often.  Will be ordering the Lickety Stik 3 pack with all flavors from Amazon.  \"Reilly\" recommends the treat!\n",

Given that I prefer sweet cereals, I was surprised to find that a serving of CV Sunrise has over 4g less sugars than my favorite cereal.  It also has slightly more calories and more calories from fat, with over 1.7 times the total fat of \"my\" cereal.  Continuing the comparison, a serving of CV Sunrise has over 28mg more sodium, over 26mg less potassium, the same total carbohydrate, about .74g more dietary fiber, about .3g more protein, no Vitamin A vs. 15%, and 4% iron vs. 25%.  Although claiming to be \"a good source of fiber\", a serving of CV Sunrise yields only 12% daily value.  I agree with other reviewers that the suggested serving size is quite small for an adult breakfast.  I also agree with those who fail to detect much vanilla flavor, an impression supported by \"natural vanilla flavor\" appearing well down the listing of ingredients.  But CV Sunrise does not disappoint in the \"C\"!  This is one CRUNCHY cereal, and its puffs keep it crunchy through the last spoonful.  I find its combination of large puffs, small puffs, and flakes more interesting than distracting.  As with many cereals, the cost of CV Sunrise would deter my having it on a regular basis, but it's not bad as a sweet, crunchy cereal.\n",

The cheese itself is a pretty mild but quite tasty cheddar. If you're reading this review, you're probably more interested in what's in the cheese. Let me tell you, there's a definite burn but as the other review mentions, it's not really off-putting. It's the consistent, enjoyable sort (definitely strong, though) without being throbbing or unpleasant.<br /><br />I'll almost certainly be keeping a stock of this cheese in the fridge from now on. :)\n",

As I am always on the lookout for a decent tasting vegetable stock or bouillion that isn't loaded with sodium or additives, I snatched a box of this \"unsalted\" veg. stock off the shelf in my local supermarket when I saw it. Then I noticed that the sodium content was 240 mg. per cup. I know that vegetables contain a certain amount of natural sodium--some more than others--but there's no way that THAT much sodium can be attributed to just the vegetables. A lot of companies lately have been sneaking salt into their products under the guise of \"Natural Flavor\" because technically, that's what salt is so they can get away with it. And since this product does contain \"Natural Flavor\" as one of it's ingredients, I'd bet the farm that's EXACTLY what they did.\n",

      "If that's what you're going for, then this is the coffee for you!<br /><br />To preface, I'm no coffee snob, but I've had my fair share of good and bad beans.  I took a chance on this brand because of an Amazon promotion, but I don't think I'll be buying any more.<br /><br />Like another reviewer, I knew I was in trouble when I opened the bag.  Characteristic of the beans that I've enjoyed the most is a rich, oily sheen left on the beans from the roasting process.  These aromatic oils are filled with flavor and provide a richness to your brew.  This bag?  The beans looked dry and oil-free.  I confirmed this when I put it through my grinder.  The grinds didn't stick to the grinder and the lid because there were no oils to bind it.  A disappointment!<br /><br />I thought to myself though, that the proof is in the taste.  So I brewed a pot and confirmed my suspicion; the coffee lacked depth and really tasted like coffee flavored water.  Now in case you think that my wife and I like our brews dark and strong, that's not the case.  We're both in preference to roasts on the light-medium end of the scale.  But this is an entirely different animal -- the flavor is just....off.<br /><br />If you're purchasing from Amazon, consider <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SJHO4M\">Kicking Horse Coffee Z-Wrangler Medium, Whole Bean Coffee, 12.3-Ounce Tins (Pack of 2)</a> instead.  When you open those tins, the aroma...it's just out of this world.  The beans are characteristically oily with a beautiful, chocolate sheen. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Z613JO\">Magnum Kona Blend Coffee, Whole Bean, 1 Lb Bag</a> is another that I can heartily recommend (though I prefer the Kicking Horse just a tad bit more).<br /><br />Yes, it's more costly, but really, it's a small luxury in this frugal era of \"staycations\" and still cheaper than buying Starbucks or DD every day.  It's safe to say that I will not be buying any more coffee of this brand.\n",

      "Chia seeds are one of the most nutritious things on earth. But they can be difficult to incorporate into the typical person's diet. Try this trick: add a couple tablespoons of Chia seeds to a health smoothy. After blending let it sit for a half hour or so in the refrigerator. The ground Chia seeds will thicken and add a pleasing, slightly jell-like consistency. It won't change the taste but will add tons of essential fats, minerals and vitamins.<br /><br />These white chia seeds seem to blend slightly better than the normal black or brown ones. 100% recommended to anybody concerned with increasing the nutritional profile of the food they eat.\n",

I guess it makes sense that now they're making a caffeinated version of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007AXVG8K\">Mio Energy Liquid Water Enhancer, 3 - Count</a>.<br /><br />As a 'water enhancer', this stuff is decent. It's not much different from the generic fruit flavor of other low/no-calorie 'water enhancers' like Crystal Light or Mio. It's got some good points, like 120% vitamin C and 40% of multiple B-vitamins, as well as some zinc and chromium. It's got a moderate caffeine zip (40mg per serving... one squeeze = one serving, two squeezes will nicely flavor a bottle of water), but it's not excessive as some energy sodas or workout powders can be.<br /><br />Aside from the fact that artificial sweeteners and caffeine are becoming WAY too common in American food/beverages (I normally try to avoid these kinds of things, but am reviewing this for the Vine program), there's only one downside to this product -- the container leaks slightly. I know it's not just my particular sample, because my coworker saw it and warned me before I'd even taken off the safety seal.

      "First, I want to review the product itself. I've used this brand of canned pumpkin before, so it was not new to me. I find the flavor to be a little more like a fresh pumpkin and the texture to be a little less creamy than mass market brands. But not to a degree where it causes problems in any of the recipes I use it in. The cost per can of ordering here on Amazon is less than what the local natural food store I usually buy it at sells it for. And since they were very low on stock last time I bought it and had no expected restocking date, I figured the savings and availibility made it worth the risk of ordering online even after reading the reviews.<br /><br />Which leads me to the packaging. Yes, as many other reviewers have reported, cans were dented. The outside packaging along with the other items in my order were in perfect condition, it was not until I got to the \"ready to ship\" flat of cans that were pre-packaged by the manufacturer that I found any damage whatsoever. 8 of the 12 cans had dents. However, they are only small dents and don't affect the safety or quality of the product in any way.

      "Unquestionably the most refined of teas, Darjeeling comes from a region in the Indian (West Bengalese) Himalayas close to the Nepalese border, 7000 ft above sea level. Originating with the small-time, private, mid-19th century plantations of a British civil surgeon named Dr. Campbell, tea has long since transformed the region into a major economic center, with over 80 running gardens producing over 10 million kgs (over 22 million lbs) of tea on a total area of almost 20,000 hectares (approximately 75 square miles), and employing over 50,000 people on a permanent basis, with a further 15,000 being hired during the plucking season (March - November). The area's natural climate with its mixture of rainfall, sunshine and rich soil makes for a very distinctive flavor, and to be called \"Darjeeling,\" tea *must* have been grown *and* processed in that particular region.<br /><br />Darjeeling tea comes in several harvest varieties or \"flushes\": the lighter Easter harvest or first flush, and the stronger Spring harvest or second flush, which has an unmistakeably fruity, Muscatel-like note. (There is also a Summer harvest or third flush, which is even stronger than the tea from the second harvest, but it is somewhat less refined and therefore less popular than the first two varieties.) Twinings' variety is a second flush tea with a subtle, quintessentially Darjeeling perfume; a great introduction to this region's exquisite teas that will hopefully make you curious for more.\n",

      "If you squish together dates & bananas, mix in finely chopped almonds, form into bars, and dry the bars a bit so they're not too sticky, you basically have a Banana Cookie LaraBar.  I think they taste quite good for packaged bars and are healthier than most of the available food bars.  They taste like, well, bananas, dates, and almonds, with the almonds providing a bit of crunch.<br /><br />Although the ingredient list is only three words long, the wrapper text extolling the healthfulness and near-magical virtues of the bar is seven lines long.  To partially quote, \"Real food, raw food... No chemicals, no fillers, no medicinal tasting supplements.  LaraBar is never cooked.  Never Processed...[will] leave you with a pleasing sense of vitality and well being for hours to come.\"  And there's more information on the wrapper, \"uncooked * unprocessed * no added sugar * non-GMO * gluten free * dairy free * soy free * vegan * kosher.\"  The LaraBar website also tells you (in case you haven't figured this out) non-irradiated, no sulfites, and no colorings.<br /><br />All this is well and good, but if they're going to the trouble of making a bar that's so fabulously healthy for you, then it would be nice if they used organic ingredients.  Eating a bar made with conventionally grown (pesticided) fruit invalidates some of the healthfulness of the bar.  The bar tastes good, but in terms of healthfulness, I think LaraBar can do better.<br /><br />P.S. And what's with the two dots above the first letter A in Lara?  Do they want us to think it's an exotically Scandinavian product?  Like Haagen Daz, Lara bars are made in the U.S.A.\n",

      "I wasn't very certain what to expect when they kept pushing 'healthy' and 'fiber' and the such in the description.  I figured it was good for me, but might have to choke down a handful to get the benefits.  Glad to say that Kind came out with a rather tasty granola without much in the way of fillers.<br /><br />The flavor is cinnamon, but it doesn't overwhelm the granola/grains. If anything, it's mild and more of an 'aftertaste' (if that can be a positive review).  It hits your tongue more after you're chewing than before and it's definitely not artificial.  The granola is more of a 'softer' kind than I've come across (probably because of the brown rice) so it's not as if you're chewing on rocks and a welcome change.  It goes very well with yogurt since it's not too strong of a flavor and it does make a good cereal.  Since there are less sweetners (molasses and cinnamon seem to be it), you get more granola per serving than others I've noticed (1/3 a cup compared to 1/4) but it still has a great taste (i.e. not cardboard).<br /><br />Definitely will keep a bag on hand for punching up yogurt or for a healthy snack.  Also, it claims to be gluten-free (I'm not an expert on this), which is a nice option to have on hand for anyone who has gluten allergies.\n",

      "If you are looking for normal chocolate-covered nuts, this is not the snack to choose. However, if you love almonds and the health benefits they have, but are on a low-carb diet, you might want to give these a try. I love chocolate, but try to stick with high-protein, low-carb snacks and I really enjoyed these cocoa roast almonds. They have just a hint of chocolate, so it's not going to satisfy a serious chocolate craving, but I really enjoyed it over typical roasted almonds, and was happy to have some chocolate flavor without having to feel guilty about the carbs that usually come with it. The powdery covering does not come off much on your fingers and while it does use Splenda, I could not detect it at all while eating them. I don't eat a lot at one sitting, so a single container lasts me a couple weeks. I definitely will be purchasing these again!\n",

      "As other viewers have pointed out, this dog food contains pesticides and grains, among other questionable ingredients. The experience with this brand has been disappointing. I appreciate Newman's Own brand but I no longer trust them with dog food and have questioned some other products from them.<br /><br />I have since switched to Blue Buffalo, as they seem to have the best reputation.<br /><br />\"Stacey\"'s review sold me on it:<br /><br />\"Dog food has changed ALOT over the past few years. As pet owners were willing to spend more money feeding their pets, larger corporations bought out the smaller dog food companies and changed the ingredients without notifying the customers. This was particularly true of the more expensive brands that contained the higher quality ingredients. Real meat and rice were substituted with \"meat by-product\" and cheap imported grains (particularly CORN) that were determined to be \"unfit for human consumption\". They are taking ingredients that used to be considered \"waste\" and packaging it up as \"healthy & nutritious\" food for your beloved pet. Our once healthy pets are contracting debilitating diseases and dying because of the toxic waste materials that are currently being marketed as pet food.<br /><br />Blue Buffalo is one of the few remaining companies that, at least to my knowledge, has not \"sold-out\" yet. The food really is nutritious and still contains real meat with no by-products, fillers, corn or soy. We switched our dogs over this past summer after having lost one to an autopsy/toxicology verified case of \"aflatoxin poisoning\" from the \"healthy & nutritious\" dog food we were buying and feeding him. This was NOT cheap food folks. This was a well-known brand, highly marketed as \"Natural\", that we were paying $60/bag for. The FDA analysis of this food verified that it contained toxins, but NOTHING was done to the dog food manufacturer. They are still producing their \"high priced waste\" and heavily marketing it as \"natural\".<br /><br />My advice to pet owners: Read the ingredients labels thoroughly and often! Blue Buffalo a great product that you can still feed your pets with confidence. Because it doesn't contain any cheap fillers, it's more satisfying to your dog so you don't need to feed as much of it thus making it still relatively economical. Don't wait until it's too late for your beloved pet. \"\n",

I tried it both with water, and with milk, and liked it both ways, but found that the chocolate taste was stronger for some reason when made with milk.  The peppermint flavor is overall stronger than the chocolate flavor, so that might be an issue for those who prefer their mocha with just a hint of mint.  I loved the flavor of it and found it leaves you with a refreshing aftertaste, sort of like you've just eaten a peppermint patty or a Thin Mint cookie.

His vet suggested that allergies might be the culprit, so before spending hundreds of dollars on allergy testing, she suggested that I switch him to a premium diet (grain-free, if possible).  Switching from a diet of Fancy Feast (aka Kitty Crack) and Friskies was no easy task! He refused to eat Blue Buffalo, Science Diet, and a few other brands of dry food.  For some unknown reason, he's taken a liking to his Wellness Complete Health! It does have a meaty, natural smell and feels slightly oily to the touch.<br /><br />His coat is much shinier, he's dandruff free, and his earwax problem has improved by about 30%.  On the downside, he's gained weight.  My vet said that this food is higher in calories than most other brands, so you'll want to be sure your cat isn't overeating.  Also, I've found that if Moses's diet isn't supplemented with wet food, he gets constipated (which was diagnosed by the tiny balls of poop that stick to his butt or end up around the house).

This one is one of my favorite flavors and I eat these almonds for a snack because I view them as being healthier than other types of snack foods. This flavor is ideal as you get the freshness of perfectly roasted almonds with just a little dose of salt.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor has only 2% of your daily intake of sodium which is good for any snack food.<br /><br />The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don't like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is the perfect one for you.

I could go through a container per week and its too pricey for that. Also- don't expect it to taste like Jiff pb. I liked the taste but I also eat mostly natural peanut butter so I'm not used to the sugary kind.<br /><br />As for the chocolate pb2- Again I wasn't impressed. I could barely taste the chocolate flavor and ended up just mixing in more cocoa powder.\n",

      "I'm not a huge packaged cookie eater, but I like regular Chips Ahoy, so I thought I'd give these a shot.  I found them somewhat pleasant, but a bit unsettling.<br /><br />For starters, the cookies came with a resealable package.  That's cool and all, but my package had been opened, presumably by the workers who shipped the cookies, and a cookie or two eaten from each row!  A few of the remaining cookies were broken, and the majority were covered in black chocolate smears.  This was not the best presentation, and although I wouldn't expect packages to be open normally, the crumbs and smears I would expect are common.<br /><br />Taste was okay, close to a classic (non chewy) chips ahoy: not too sweet and somewhat cracker-like.<br /><br />The texture was a bit too crumbly, but similar to regular chips ahoy.  The gooey insides were not as gross as I expected.  More of a drier chocolate pudding.<br /><br />Ingredients were better than expected.  There's still a lot of sugar, but no hydrogenated oils or high fructose corn syrup. That's nice to see in a mass market product like this.<br /><br />Overall I found the cookies okay, but unimpressive.  Buy a single box before you go for the box of 4.\n",

Once I drank it for one week and got on schedule, I only drink a cup once or twice a week.  The only drawback is the tast; however, I put either honey or, MORE BENEFICIALLY, Black Cherry Juice Concentrate (which helps with my arthritis)in for flavoring.  There are NO cramps or any other side effects to this remedy.  It has also relieved the bloating in my stomach and I can now wear my smaller sized clothes, which I had packed away for this day.<br /><br />My brother has been drinking the old fiber stuff every morning of his life for well over 15 years.  He was complaining to me that it just didn't seem to be working any more and I told him about GET REGULAR.  \"No,\" he said, \"I'm just afraid to stop using what I've been using.\"  \"Well,\" I said, \"What do you have to lose.  I'll send you 3 or 4 tea bags to try, but be sure to put some kind of flavoring in it because it tastes bad.  I use Black Cherry Juice Concentrate.\"  He finally tried it and called me immediately wanting to know how to order it.<br /><br />My daughter's live-in boyfriend, who is paralized from the waist down, wanted to try it because I had told her about it when she mentioned his problem.  I sent him four (4) bags to try and he called me the next day and ask if I would order some for him.<br /><br />Thank you, Amazon, for keeping all my orders straight and thank you, Yogi, for making this ALL NATURAL way for relieving my stress (anyone who's experienced this knows what I'm talking about).<br /><br />Thank you also, Amazon, for keeping the best price available for this tea.

However, once that first bite was in my mouth it's evident it was not. The chocolate in these bards over powers the taste of anything else. Like I said, I'm a chocolate fan but this was just too potent of chocolate for my tastes.<br /><br />Since there were a dozen in the box I decided to let a few others try them. It was a mixed bag of results there too. One person took one bite and would have no more. One said they were okay with coffee. One person ate an entire bar before deeming it \"not very good\". The last person really liked them and said he would buy them in a store.

      "Since hubby & I switched to a primal/paleo diet it has killed me to buy dog food that listed wheat as the first ingredient and usually corn as the second. I looked at many, many reviews of many grain free dog foods, ingredients lists, pros, cons, etc before ultimately choosing this food for my boys. I have a 9 year old chocolate and 5 year old black lab. The 9 year old has chronically had an incredibly dull coat and an energy level that is increasingly low. I know, he's no spring chicken, but he was beginning to look far older than he really is. The 5 year old has always been very active with a fairly shiny coat. We switched them over slowly, as everything I read said to do & within a week it was easy to see that the older dog's coat was shinier especially around his face. A month in & completely switched over to this food, the chocolate's coat is shiny, smooth, and soooo much softer than he has ever been since he was a puppy. The black lab is even shinier than he was before. Their eyes are brighter and even the old guy seems to have more energy. The switch was easy for us, we live very rural and I have dogs who drag home dead animals and will eat pretty much anything, so no issues there. I noticed around about week 3 they were getting chubby and so we have cut back the amount we feed to what seems about right. Definitely feeding less than we did before & I think less \"deposits\" to be picked up in the back yard!<br /><br />We are so happy we made the change to a grain free food for our boys. I was concerned knowing there had been recalls in the past but looking at ingredients and reviews and taking prices into consideration, I think this is definitely the best for the money!\n",

On opening I was surprised  how much like human  food it looked and smelled and was sure she would love it. Well, one sniff and she looked at me as if I were  nuts. My other more finky cat likewise.  I tried  again a few weeks later with the same results.<br />I then decided to let a neighbor try it since I did not want it to go to waste.  His cat had the same results.  No deal.  He  then put some out for  four ferral cats  he was feeding . NO takers.  It is hard to believe that not one  of seven cats would refuse something hailed as so tempting unless the food was defective..<br />I would not try this food unless youi needed some cans to hold up a bookcase.<br />If looking for a premium chicken try Instinct. A bit pricy but my cats love it. I also learned not to fix a good thing.  Cats are not like  humans and don't seem to mind the same food everyday.\n",

I don't know about you, but my dogs treats are kept in a certain area and they are not fed people food.

      "Wow, these are really good!  At first, I didn't understand \"Popchips\", and I was actually expecting something like regular fried potato chips, only made from sweet potatos.  The Popchips are very different from that!<br /><br />These contain rice flour as well as sweet potatos, and they are kind of air-popped, very light like popcorn.  Texture-wise, they remind me of \"Munchos\" only lighter and without the oily feel and taste.  Remember Munchos?  These are WAY better.<br /><br />Next thing - the flavor from the sweet potatos is YUMMY!  I know when I first read \"rice flour\" in the ingredients, I was thinking those cardboard-like rice cakes.  The sweet potato completely takes away any blandness or boringness and adds good taste.  And there is just a touch of salt - just enough to bring out the YUM without overdoing it.<br /><br />Finally, the package size.  When I saw \"0.8 ounce\", I expected that I would want two, three, or even four bags of these at a time.  Nope - one bag is a good snack!  Not that 0.8 is a big bag, or \"filling\" or anything like that, but the bag is just the right size, which is a very pleasant surpise to me!  I finish the last chips, like the last of the salt from my fingers, and I feel satisfied - like, wow, that was tasty and just right!  At Amazon's prices, I believe I will be buying these regularly!\n",

The 5 grams of protein in it is just a bonus. I put it in protein shakes with a lot of other ingredients [...], and the taste still shines through and really improves the overall taste of the shake.<br /><br />The only downside to it, if there is one, is that it is pretty expensive. Even if you buy the 12 pack at $70 with prime, that still works out to almost $0.40 per serving, which is pretty steep for peanut butter.

      "The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed \"high-end\" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, good carbs and oils, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like \"liver flavor\" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it.\n",

I find most K cups are good for up to a 12 ounce cup, and 16 ounces would weaken them too much...  But this works for my wife and I since I have been fixing a cup for each of us for years, and brewing two cups with one K cup is economical.\n",

      "I enjoy the taste of chicory in my coffee. I 'used to' buy the fairly expensive Louisiana style coffee, with chicory, and mix that in with my favorite coffee. That worked but it was awkward and got to be expensive. This product is 100% roasted chicory. As the advertising says, it is a medium-dark roast. The Louisiana style coffees use a French roast (almost burnt) that does not appeal to all.<br /><br />I only wish that this product was sold in smaller quantities. I only use about a tablespoon of chicory per pot of coffee. The 'best if used by' date on the product I received was for six months into the future. There is no way I can see myself using up all six bags by then. It is still a very good value.<br /><br />Enjoy.<br /><br />Ken\n",

I was really happy to have the opportunity to sample Back to Nature Golden Honey Oat Grahams because I'd already seen them on the shelf at Whole Foods and was tempted to give them a try--fortuitous timing! :)<br /><br />Those who try these will find that they're somewhat different than the commercial grahams they're used to. Since the grahams I buy contain molasses, they're rather heartier than these in flavor albeit not as crisp in texture. There's no getting around the fact that graham crackers are dry--these are no exception. But they have a lovely crispness that's missing in commercial grahams and although the flavor is more delicate than my Nabiscos, it's really nice--not too sweet and the oats carry a sweetness of their own (I love oats). It's nice to find a whole-grain product that's tastes this good.<br /><br />There's no sense in belaboring the point--these are simple graham crackers, after all. But if you like graham crackers and would like to combine a tasty nosh with wholesome ingredients, definitely give these a try--I don't think you'll be disappointed.\n",

      "This will be the shortest review I've ever written, because it's based soley personal taste when it comes to beef sticks.<br /><br />I didn't like the X Sticks. I wouldn't even put them in the same universe as <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RFS57I\">Jack Link's Beef Stick, Original, 0.92-Ounce Sticks (Pack of 72)</a> or any of the beef sticks that Jack Links makes based on the 'Original' formula/base. I dig all of their flavored stuff, spicy stuff, etc, as long as it's based on the original beef stick variety.<br /><br />The X Sticks taste... like potted beef, wrapped into a beef stick? I don't know, It's odd. I'm still going to eat all 50 of them or whatever; they're not awful. Just \"okay\"; and in my world of seriously loving beef jerky and beef sticks, being just \"okay\" is a crime...\n",

The box containing the coffee does not have any instructions as to how to brew the pod. When I researched the Marley website, it referred only to pod brewing. So, with only an espresso machine in my possession, I decided to be inventive and brew the pods that way.<br /><br />I like my coffee STRONG, and I found that 1 pod was too weak for my usual morning cup. If I can see through the coffee, it's not strong enough. Two pods are perfect; I just jam both into the ground holder. The taste is smooth, dark, slightly bitter, but still enjoyable and makes for a nice caffeine buzz. It's 100% organic and Fair Trade-very important to me. With the grounds contained in pods, it is easier to remove and keep the ground holder clean.<br /><br />The downside of the pod coffee is the separate foil packaging for each individual pod. I would prefer it packaged as a group in the box, like tea bags. However, the company does offer bags of beans which I find more preferable than ground coffee in a pod.\n",

      "I bought Dogswell Vitality for Dogs Chicken Breast for my finicky Boston Terrier after visiting my mom's and she gave him a dried chicken meat treat which he devoured. But I didn't like how brittle and hard the jerky treat was and made me concerned about him choking on it, even after breaking them into bite size pieces. I found Dogswell Vitality for Dogs at Target and gave it try after feeling through the bag that it wasn't as hard as the other dried meat treats with a slight bendable feel to it plus the disclaimer that the flaxseed and vitamins included helped dog's healthy eyes, skin and coat. The reason the disclaimer appealed to me is my dog has dry, flaky skin and occasionally gets dry patches.<br /><br />I have tried all types of shampoos, both prescribed by the vet and store bought, even RX fish oil pills from my vet, which I disliked giving my dog because I don't like putting pill in mouth daily since I couldn't trick him by putting it on his food. I can say none of them worked near as well as Dogswell Vitality for Dogs Chicken Breast for his skin problems.<br /><br />I've been given my dog, who weighs approx. 18 lbs., two to three strips a day broken into bite size pieces for nearly two months now. After about two weeks, I noticed the flaky dry skin scales weren't as noticeable and now it's barely noticeable at all. When I noticed the difference at two weeks I started ordering Dogswell Vitality for Dogs Chicken Breast through Amazon's Subscribe and Save program because I knew this treat was going to be a regular part of my dog's daily meal plan going forward and the program helps cut the cost of these expensive dog treats.<br /><br />I do recommend in an additional to this treats zip bag, putting the treats in a second ziploc type bag to help keep the jerky strips from drying out further and loosing it small bit of moisture. I have found this keeps the jerky strips as moist as when you first open the bag. And even though these jerky treats aren't as brittle and hard as it's competitors, they are still brittle enough that I feel I need to break them into bite size pieces for my dog.\n",

Usually the sensation is: \"Wow - it really sorta DOES taste like (fill in the blank for the flavor)\", then has an aweful aftertaste AND WORST - ALWAYS tastes like a CHEMICAL VERSION of the flavor it's supposed to be.  This stuff - I swear tastes a bit like REAL Vanilla beans were just wrung out over your cup and stirred in.<br /><br />We had it as a K-Cup amongst a variety of some 10 flavors.  I kept loving it and just remembered that it was \"the one with a blue label\".  I was surprised later it was good ol' Folgers.

Note: My best friend and I hunt, fish, and we all drive pickup trucks and/or big motorcycles.<br /><br />I thought - I HAVE to write a review for this place.  Hence, here it is.  It's NOT cheap.  But - HOW much value do you place on utterly enjoying a cup of coffee?  How SHORT is life?  And you're only paying (per bag) about 2.5 cups of coffee at Starbucks (which tastes like potting soil anyway).<br /><br />Try it - you'll LOVE it!\n",

I'm averaging around 10 minutes of sweetness per two rectangles.  Weak.  Otherwise, it is a solid gum, it's good for your teeth (per my dentist) due to the high amount of xylitol.

It's hard to find in stores so ordering it directly by the case may be your only option but it's a great price and terrific product.\n",

      "I chose this from the Vine program because I rather like caramel popcorn.  As far as caramel popcorn goes, this is a pretty tasty snack.  Flavor-wise, I thought it had a very good caramel taste, but I felt like the chocolate drizzle was a bit overkill.  I just felt like the chocolate didn't add anything good to the flavor (plus the chocolate itself doesn't taste all that good).  What else to say about these?  Well, they come in little \"130 calorie packs\".  This is useful and convenient for those on a diet but honestly that would be the only reason to get this particular product.  It's probably ten million times cheaper to get a regular large size bag of caramel popcorn than to buy this thing, so the only thing it would be good for is counting calories precisely.  If you need it for that purpose, then this product is good enough, but if you're not on a diet or anything, just get a regular bag of caramel popcorn and chow down on that instead.\n",

      "\"Green Tea with Pomegranate and Acai\" seems more like an attempt to cash in on a health fad instead of creating a balanced and delicious tea.  Here you have three products that have recently been hailed as miracle foods all bundled into one cuppa together.<br /><br />Although the health benefits and drawbacks of both green tea and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1932657746\">pomegranate juice</a> have been well-documented, the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QZWTDS\">Acai berry's</a> claims are more tenuous.  Acai berries have fewer antioxidants than grapes or blueberries, and no credible evidence exists supporting the other miraculous claims.  Even so, with this tea listing \"pomegranate and acai flavors\" as the final ingredient on the package, the amount of each fruit is so minimal as to be inconsequential.  There is far more \"organic hibiscus\" and \"organic rose hips\" in this tea than either pomegranate or acai \"flavors.\"<br /><br />But the real bottom line on any tea is the \"Green Tea with Pomegranate and Acai\" just doesn't taste very nice.

      "My favorite is the Italian Roast.  I never liked 'instant' until I tried this.<br /><br />This might sound a bit odd, but I love this even more iced (or at least chilled).  I needed to go spend the day visiting an ailing relative at the hospital a couple of years ago.  I dreaded not being near some decent coffee.  I got the idea to pour a packet into a bottle (16oz) of water that I was taking along.  At least I would have some coffee with me, right.  How bad could it be?  It was great!!<br /><br />Let me say that it takes a while (5-6 minutes) to dissolve and mix properly.  I usually open the bottle, take a small sip of water (leaves a bit more room for 'shaking'), add the packet, shake, and then let it sit a couple of minutes before shaking again.  Instant cold coffee.  I later tried the Starbuck's Iced Coffee packets, but those are way too sweet for me.  I do not like it sweetened.  Those are made to dissolve quickly, but I would rather shake a little longer and wait a few minutes to have this Italian Roast.<br />Of course, you could just add the VIA to a small glass of water, stir, and add ice (which I do if I am home).<br /><br />I find I use the 'bottle method' whenever I will be away from the house for hours.  For me, I use a purse which fits a water bottle perfectly and it's nice to have.  It's also very convenient to throw a few packets of VIA in my purse while I am traveling or away from the house all day just to have with me.  You can get water anywhere, but not always a decent coffee.<br /><br />I realize the review should be ALL about the coffee, but I think anyone looking to purchase this product can be pretty confindent by the *star* rating that the taste is good.  It is!  I just wanted to add that Starbuck's made a customer of me BECAUSE of their VIA Ready Brew and not because I stand in line in one of their stores trying to figure out how to order a coffee.  lol!<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00438ZXAM\">Starbucks VIA® Ready Brew Italian Roast Coffee (50 count)</a>\n",

But on the sofa, these bars do not satisfy;  they are far more savory (and not in a delectable way) than sweet, and necessitate a tall drink of anything.  The pumpkin flavor prevails over the banana, followed closely by the taste of the boiled apple juice.  I crumbled apart an entire bar just to count the molecular-sized chocolate chips (3).  While I do like Kashi cereal, I'll be disposing of - rather than digesting - the remainder of the box.  I would much rather go to the trouble of baking my own banana/pumpkin/whole wheat bread with proper adult-sized chocolate chips.

      "I was one of fifty families chosen to receive Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters for free to do a product review on.  Once I received my Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters in the mail, I and two of my grandsons decided to do the taste test immediately.<br /><br />The box of Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters comes with five individual packages.  Each package is 100 calories.  In fact, the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters are advertised as being 100 calorie packs so that people will know exactly how many calories they are having so there is no guesswork involved.  Each 100 calorie package comes with three Oreo mini cakesters which translates to each mini cakester having approximately thirty-three and one third calories.<br /><br />The appearance of the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters is one of tiny chocolatey goodness.  They are a dark chocolate color with a thin slice of cream filling and are soft and slightly crumbly.  When you put a Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters into your mouth, they crumble into a delicious chocolate cake flavor.  In fact, they do remind me a little of having a small bite of chocolate cake.  The Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters mostly have a chocolate flavor and the cream filling isn't as easily tasted or rather it wasn't possible to isolate the flavor of the cream from the chocolate but I didn't have a problem with this and neither did either of my grandsons.<br /><br />My oldest grandson ate almost two 100 calories packs of the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters minus one or approximately 167 calories.  He enjoyed eating them and even gave Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters his `lick of approval' to the wrapper they came in!<br /><br />My youngest grandson isn't able to communicate effectively verbally (he's special needs) but I considered his dedication to eating his Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters as a sign of approval as seen through his chocolate face and intensity as he ate his 100 calorie pack plus the one loose one from his older brother or his approximately 134 calories.<br /><br />I definitely give the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters a thumbs up.  I believe that I really got a true sense of how good they tasted from my two 100 calorie packs or 200 calories worth of Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters that I ate. I honestly didn't mean to eat both 100 calorie packs but that last one was sitting there calling my name and my adult daughter was not home yet so, I ate it.  But luckily I know that all I had was 200 calories which in the grand scheme of things is not too bad at all!<br /><br />I like the fact that the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters are presented as a 100 calorie pack.  I found the thought comforting especially since I ate two packages of them!  I even found it fun to know how many calories my grandsons were consuming of them too!!  I am diabetic and overweight besides so knowing the calorie count is a good thing for me.  I think the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters are good for a small chocolatey treat when you just want something sweet and chocolate but you don't want to overindulge.<br /><br />If I have any complaint about the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters, it would be that they are too small!!  But since that is actually part of their appeal, I don't consider their small size a problem.<br /><br />I do recommend Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters for anyone who wants a small and controlled portion of a chocolate treat because they are the perfect size to keep you in control of your diet instead of letting the chocolate treat control you.\n",

I first tried it on its own and the consistency was not too appealing to me, so I began putting it in my meals and that works better for me.  I have also used a portion of it with some Shea Butter as a moisturizer and it works great as well.  It seems to me the uses are endless.  I can see that I will be purchasing another container of this because it is so versatile and all natural.  I really love that and I love this coconut oil.  It does have a slight coconut taste and smell.  I get a hint of it when i cook with it but it is does not over power any of the dishes that I make with it.  Also it absorbs very quickly into the skin leaving it soft but not greasy and there is slight coconut smell but it fades quickly once absorb into the skin.  It is a bit pricey and is definitely an investment.  The serving size of 1 tablespoon 3-4 times a day is a bit much and will contribute to the necessity of purchasing another jar quicker than I would like.  Overall, very happy with my purchase.

But I'm trying to control sugar intake and I have not found myself eating more than one at a time.

Almost every day led to high-stress discussions about whether she might have a life-threatening blockage.  Visits to the vet and internal medicine specialist cost us $3,500, and led to a complicated, expensive drug regimen.  The $3,500 of vet analysis basically concluded with \"We don't know why it happened, and it's really not fixable; you just have to manage it.\"  They recommended a special diet food sold solely through vets.  It was ridiculously expensive.  We looked out at a 15 or 18 year time horizon, and thought, man, that is just insane.  I mean, if you have a 15 year old cat and you're facing a year or two of special diet food, then OK.  But a whole cat lifetime of prescription food? Only after other approaches have been tried.<br /><br />So we picked up a case of this food, along with Purina's dry food for FLUTD cats.  And that very day, her flutd STOPPED.  Period.  She has not had a single, solitary incident of straining or sign of discomfort since.  It's been about two months.<br /><br />And, both she and our other cat (who has no flutd issues) LOVE this food.  They stand at the bowls and meow for it, in a way that we have not seen them do for any other food.  Sadly, this food is only offered in one flavor (chicken), so our plan was to feed it to them for as long as they would tolerate it, and then integrate in some other non-FLUTD foods, to give them the variety that cats usually demand.  Well, they have eaten this one flavor every day for two months, and they continue to lick the bowls dry and empty every single day....and STILL stand there meowing for more of it, the next morning.  Insane...<br /><br />So far, so good, and this seems like a fantastic product.\n",

      "I use California Natural Lamb & Rice for my 10 year old shepherd Terrier mix. She has a very sensitive stomach and after years of trying numerous different brands this one finally made a difference. It's all natural and only has three ingredients: lamb meal, rice, and sunflower oil so how could you go wrong. With other foods my dog used to have soft stools and vomit frequently but that rarely happens anymore. When it does, I give her California Natural canned food (any variety) and that seems to help even better than the dry. However, I stick with the dry because it's cheaper and better for her teeth. I have a lot of faith in this food and highly recommend it for any dog.\n",

I would call it luke warm hot, but the flavor of this sauce is very good which is why I give it 5 stars.  If you are looking for crazy hot, try Dave's Gourmet Insanity Sauce (which I have also tried and reviewed) or Daves Gourmet Ghost Pepper (which I haven't tried, but if it is hotter than Insanity, it must be ridunkulous hot).  I like my hot sauce to have some flavor which is why I like this Habanero Sauce...the flavor is very good...just not very hot.  I can actually just put this sauce straight to the tongue without much of a problem.

Most women who see this chew in person will experience a momentary impression that it resembles, yes, I'll say it, a diaphragm.  On a serious and positive note, the round chew is challenging for dogs to grasp when the chew is concave to the floor.  Hardwood makes an excellent shuffleboard surface and my dogs kick and chase it for fun.  The exterior is somehow resistant to dog saliva, so messy floor streaks and drool spots were surprisingly absent.  My two dogs kick it, chase it and trot about the house with these very durable chews for days.  Eventually, something possesses the dogs and they start working at dismantling the 'bone'.  It literally takes hours of dedicated canine chomping and gnawing for the chew to be reduced to crumbs.  The final word is that there are no intestinal after effects in what I have observed in my two English Springers.

      "I bought this thing after a recommendation from a pet store rep. My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it's organic. Real \"premium\" dog foods brag that they've no corn.<br /><br />Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real \"premium\" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap, but it's not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real \"premium\" dog foods do not have.<br /><br />In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients. I ended up buying Blue Buffalo Wilderness and I have not looked back.\n",

They added rice, took away certain seasonings, and added a DISGUSTING tasting ACID. It tastes like im eating a LEMON. This tastes like a completely different snack - I dont buy it anymore. WHY OH WHY DID THEY CHANGE THE RECIPE. GOD HELP US.<br /><br />Original review:<br /><br />These krinkle sticks are the best baked low fat snack EVER. NO QUESTION. They have a great crunch and a HUGE SERVING SIZE!!!! You would have no idea they are so low in fat! They are seasoned to perfection. Sometimes the seasoning can settle to the bottom a bit and the sticks near the bottom are seasoned more (MORE FLAVOR NOM NOM NOM NOM). They are baked, not oily, but still taste awesome.<br /><br />You HAVE to try these. I prefer the regular sea salt flavor.\n",

      "I received a pound of Buffalo Bill's hickory pieces as a gift, and enjoyed the size of the pieces and the consistency of the beef's tenderness and flavor. The box happened to come with a couple of samples courtesy of Choo Choo snacks, one of which were a few pieces of the maple pepper beef jerky. After finishing the hickory I went ahead and opened up the maple, and ate it all in maybe 30 seconds. This jerky is so unique and borderline mouthwatering, I actually broke down and bought a pound of it. It's just ever so slightly spicy, and the smell and taste of the maple syrup hits you at the start then lingers after you've finished it. I don't profess to be some sort of food critic, but I figured something this tasty deserved a review with a few big words. So if you like eating healthy and are looking for a nice treat, I really recommend this!\n",

BUT, I am a tea reviewer and above all, it is important for me to tell it like it is, and sometimes that requires me to say something is bad when it is.<br /><br />And unfortunately, this Peach Matcha just doesn't hold up to the other Matcha teas that I've tried.  I've tried quite a few of Red Leaf Tea's Matcha (as you can tell by looking at the number of reviews that I've posted), and there have only been two that I've not enjoyed - this one and the apricot.<br /><br />Prepared traditionally using hot water and whisking, this is has a strong chemical taste that is really off-putting.  However ... and this Matcha's one redeeming quality which is why I gave it two stars instead of one ... if you make it as a latte, it ends up tasting much better.  The chemical taste is nearly gone (there are still traces of this taste, but it is very faint) and I can taste the peach and the matcha.  These flavors are also muted a bit because of the milk, but, it makes a nice, tasty matcha latte that tastes of matcha and peach.<br /><br />However, even though the latte was far better than the traditionally prepared Matcha ... I can't give it a higher rating because of that chemical taste.  I do hope that Red Leaf Tea considers finding a better flavoring for the peach and the apricot.  I had high hopes for them.\n",

      "I've been familiar with bottled Ribena for more than half a century and no matter what type of bottle it comes in, it remains as it always was. I have not tried the alternative flavors, nor have I ever bought Ribena in cartons. So my review is limited to the original blackcurrant drink and while my own taste has changed over the years, Ribena has never changed the original drink despite experimenting with alternatives.<br /><br />The blackcurrant is a fruit native to Britain and some other European countries, but its most important quality as a food is that it is rich in Vitamin C. It was once popular in America prior to being banned there early in the 20th century because blackcurrants were seen as a threat to the logging industry. The decision to continue the ban was eventually delegated to state level and some states now permit blackcurrants to be grown. Nevertheless, blackcurrants may struggle to regain their former American popularity.<br /><br />Meanwhile in Britain, Ribena was launched in 1936. Blackcurrants became popular in World War II because so many other fruits became hard to obtain and the government encouraged blackcurrant production by providing free blackcurrant drinks (actually Ribena without the brand name) to children, to give them that all-important Vitamin C. With peace restored, the Ribena brand went from strength to strength in its home market. As a post-war baby boomer, I was inevitably introduced to Ribena and it was my favorite drink as a child. My tastes changed and I grew out of it, but never forgot its medicinal value.<br /><br />As an adult, I have as far as possible avoided medicines and pills of any kind. I believe in letting my body learn to cope with the nasty stuff that comes along, at least for a while. When I feel the time is right to help nature cure me of my ills, I buy a bottle of Ribena. Whether it's because of the Vitamin C or because of the other blackcurrant nutrients I wouldn't know, but Ribena has helped me get over many a bad illness.<br /><br />There will be those who drink Ribena for the pure pleasure of it, as I did back in the fifties and sixties. As such, it can be drunk hot or cold, remembering that it is concentrated and needs plenty of added water.  Medicinally, I always drink it hot. Those who follow my reviews may have wondered why I suddenly stopped just as I was getting into reviewing again after a long hiatus. Yes, I had a particularly nasty cold/flu/whatever and Ribena is aiding my recovery, which is by no means complete as I write this. Hey, Ribena is not a magic potion, merely a drink.\n",

      "I love granola bars, and I have often used them to satisfy a sweet craving to keep me away from something like a candy bar (even small ones).  This bar certainly looks great with a chocolate coated bottom, and some drizzled on the top.  Its on the small side, but that is happening more and more as we see more bars that are fewer calories and such.  This is a nice mix of protein and fiber, although, typically I personally either want a lot of fiber, or a lot of protein.  You will need to figure out if the mix of nutrients meets your needs.  I still seemed to be hungry after eating the bar.<br /><br />As far as taste, it has a sweet taste - I'm not sure how to describe it - maybe honey-like, but chocolate did not stand out, maybe because this was \"dark chocolate\".  I marked it down one star because even being dark chocolate, it just didn't even stand out at all.<br /><br />I recommend this bar as a light snack if you need something sweet, a little fiber, a little protein, and you aren't a big chocolate lover.\n",

I haven't baked with it yet though and I'm happy to know that its a lot healthier for me.

She's been eating this for several years, same flavor and everything, and she still comes running when she hears the food being prepped. If you want a healthy pet don't look any further than this! It's organic and there isn't a single ingredient that I can't pronounce.

The Chipotle sauce is nice and bland which is how most people like their food but it really does not pack the kick that a typical authentic Chipotle sauce has.

So if you don't care about organic tea, and you want a nice chai with strong cinnamon overtones, this is a pretty good one.

      "Before I go any further in this review, I have to admit that I initially didn't know that this came in pods when I requested it. For whatever reason, I missed the pod image in the picture, so when I received this I ended up using several pods to create a full pot of coffee. This did impact anyone who is wondering what it might be like to brew one individual pod, which I will try to brew with my father's french press. Anywho, on with the review. I just wanted to be up front when I say that my experience might not be like that of someone who owns a Senseo.<br /><br />Smell-wise, this stuff is awesome. It smelled great when I was brewing it, which is honestly about 30-40% of what I (and many others) enjoy most about coffee. Taste-wise, this was pretty good. It's definitely a dark roast, so if you prefer a more mild flavor then you'll probably want to look elsewhere. (Not sure if Marley coffee has a lighter roast, but they probably should.) It's not Charbucks, so no worries about it being too roasted.<br /><br />I brewed this at work and after the pre-requisite jokes about a \"pot\" of coffee and such, we all set about to consuming it. Now while we do have to put up with some of the worst free coffee possible, it only serves to help us appreciate the good stuff when it comes along, and this is some good stuff and was pretty well received. I had a lot of people that came back and told me that they really enjoyed the brew. (For food items, if I can get a wider opinion, I try to do so because hey- not all opinions are the same when it comes to any product.) So if you have a Senseo that multiple people use or if you're considering buying a regular bag for multiple people to use, this is something you can get for a wide audience of drinkers.<br /><br />I have to say, this is something that I'd actually purchase with my own money later on down the line. It's a good coffee and while I don't base my purchases on the whole \"organic, fair trade\" stuff, I know that others do and I have to admit that it is nice to think that the coffee purchase potentially helped someone other than myself. (The whole organic, fair trade thing didn't really factor into my opinion, but I know that this is important to some consumers so I wanted to make sure to make a note of this since the product description for this didn't have any of this in it.)\n",

      "I bought this for my Boston Terrier, Cookie, who can destroy most toys in less than an hour.  I thought the idea of a treat inside would slow her down a little.  Unfortunately, the treat did not suit her finicky palate, and she simply worked it out of the ball and left it on the floor.  The ball itself, however, has turned out to be Cookie-proof.  Months after the purchase, she still plays with it.  It bounces nicely, and doesn't roll under the furniture as much as other balls.  I've also found that if I stuff it with her regular treats (small bits of chicken jerky) or her kibble, it does keep her occupied for a while.  Although she chews on it, I can find very little evidence of toothmarks, so whatever this is made of is pretty strong.  I would give this more stars if it was easier to load, but then it would probably be easier for her to un-load.  Overall, a tough little toy, and one of Cookie's favorites.  A little pricey, but hey, she's worth it!\n",

When I opened the individual pack, I was hit with a wonderful coffee scent.  The pod looks typical, and are made for a pod machine.  When I made my first cup, since the aroma was strong, I filled the machine with a good sized mug's worth of water, and made a cup.  When it was done, the color was fairly light, so I only added a small amount of milk.  Still, the flavor was a bit too bland for me, and I like a mild coffee.

      "I recently moved to California and I have yet to find any place that serves anything close to Cincinnati/Greek style chili. I am super impressed with this stuff.<br /><br />If you normally avoid canned food, I wouldn't worry here.  Skyline lends itself well to being canned because it's usually slowly cooked over a long period of time anyway, the meat is ground very fine and the overall consistency is very smooth. Honestly, I can't really tell the difference from the \"real thing\" in the restaurants; I don't think it's missing anything.  In fact, I'm not sure why anyone even buys it frozen from Cincinnati-area grocers. In this case, canned is so much easier to prepare; crack it open and throw it on the stove (preferably in a cooking vessel, such as a pot), heats up very quickly. I save fridge space and energy. Done.<br /><br />Also, some pointers: one can tends to be enough for me and my wife. I'd say one 10.5 oz. can is about 3 small or 2 regular size n-ways, maybe a little bit more (Skyline folks will know what I mean :-). I like a 5-way, so I add a handful of canned red beans and chopped onions to the spaghetti just before pouring the chili over. Mound your mild cheddar over that and it is the real deal.<br /><br />The price is quite reasonable on Amazon and I can get my Skyline fix every once in a while. If you are missing Cincinnati style chili, I think you'll be pleased.\n",

I was really surprised to see a fruit-veggie product like this one had so much calcium (30%) on the package compared to most of the other baby fruits out there (usually 0-2% unless veggies or yogurt's added in) and chose this over other products, thinking the extra calcium would be worth the extra $ for my baby in the long run. When you check it against Ella's website, it's only 2%! Same goes for all the other stage 1 Ella's fruits (carrots/apples/parships: 20% calcium on package but 0% on the website, peaches and bananas 10% calcium on package vs. 0% on website all the same serving size) -- there were other differences too in protein, iron, etc. It does cost a lot more than some of the other organic baby fruits out there and tastes awful. If your baby is just as content with the other less expensive organic baby fruits out there, go with the cheaper alternative because nutrition wise, Ella's no better!<br /><br />What a disgusting marketing ploy by Ella's Kitchen to get parents to choose their products because it is falsely more nutritious when it's the same as other organic baby fruits in terms of nutritional value.\n",

      "After enjoying Passion Iced Tea at Starbucks brick and mortar stores, I was excited to make some at home with the filter bags. I would have never ordered it if I knew that it would cost me not only $27 but hours of dealing with customer service with no resolution, no filter bags, and no refund.<br /><br />In short:<br />At the end of the day, only purchase from companies you can trust. Starbucks is no longer in my list of go to trust-worthy companies. I now purchase Mighty Leaf Teas instead.<br /><br />The full story:<br />I purchased two starbucks products the Passion Iced Tea Filter bags (PITFB)and Earl Grey Tea Bags. I received the Tea Bags but not the Passion Iced Tea. I inquired with Starbucks to follow-up on the missing merchandise. Starbucks advised that the PITFB were mailed out in a separate box from the Earl Grey bags but in the same shipment. I advised that I only received one box with the shipment. At first Starbucks emailed me that the  me that I would receive a subsequent shipment.<br /><br />\"Thank you for contacting Starbucks Online Ordering.<br />We apologize for the inconvenience you have experienced with your order.<br />After further research, all of the items shipped out but separately.<br />Please allow 5 to 10 business days to receive the remaining part of your<br />order.\"<br /><br />When no new order ID generated after 10 days, I called Starbucks and was told that they would not send out a new shipment. Starbucks advised that they checked their inventory and because their \"counts matched\", a replacement would not be sent and they could determine that the passion iced tea had been mailed.<br /><br />I asked for the tracking number that was associated with the PITFB so I could investigate further. Starbucks stated that they sent two separate boxes but with one tracking number. Starbucks insisted that I file a claim with the carrier. I spoke with the carrier who stated that each box should have a tracking number. The one tracking number that was given with the order was delivered (the earl grey tea bags)so UPS could not honor a claim on the second box because there was no second tracking number on the missing merchandise. Starbucks response was that because UPS would not honor their claim (because Starbucks didn't only used one tracking # for 2 boxes) that I was out of luck and nothing further could be done.<br /><br />Starbucks, a company that I have traditionally enjoyed doing business with, has discouraged me from purchasing their products again...on Amazon or otherwise. The customer service agent and his supervisor's inability to address the shipping department's error and take no responsibility for seeing the transaction through is incredibly disappointing. I expected more from a company that is praised for its customer-centric attitude when in reality Starbucks neither offered to replace the unreceived merchandise nor refund the cost of the PITFB.<br /><br />I have attempted to obtain a refund through Amazon's A-to-Z Guarantee Program on June 16. As of 09-02-11 and several inquiries to Amazon, I still have not received a credit to my Amazon account nor a refund to my credit card.<br /><br />This has been my worst Amazon experience to date.\n",

      "A nutritionist recommended truffle oil to me as a healthy alternative to butter. I don't use a lot of butter to begin with but am always looking for ways to improve my diet and I do like popcorn with butter, it's kind of my \"downfall\" Well, the nutritionist recommended truffle oil I then e-mailed her and asked her \"which one\" white or dark truffle? She said both are good, the white is milder. I have only used this on a couple of items so far. I've used it on steamed pot stickers and on some bow tie pasta. I must say, it is the most delicious condiment...I never would have dreamed that a flavored olive oil could be so magnificent! And fortunately, a little bit goes a long way because it is, as you can see, rather expensive. I haven't tried it on popcorn yet. Instead I bought some of the 100 calorie Jiffy Pop Microwave Kettle Corn (also available from Amazon and also recommended by my nutritionist). It too is great and needs not butter or anything added.<br /><br />You really should try truffle oil. I don't know how this particular brand measures up to the other brands but I can tell you this Plantin White Truffle infused oil is delicious. I believe you can buy this product with confidence. I am going to order some more but I'm going to order the dark truffle instead just so I'll experience the difference.<br /><br />One final note: I was warned that once opened it can go rancid rather quickly. Accordingly, I've been storing mine in the refrigerator and when I want to use it I just take the cap off and microwave it for about 20 seconds. Voila! This is truly a gourmet and HEALTHY item. Enjoy!\n",

      "The eternal dieter's quest: A replacement for oily, fatty, and oh-so-addictive real potato chips. Sure, you can get the baked versions, but they lack a bit in both the crunch and flavor categories. And they cost a lot.<br /><br />So the quest continues. I got a case of these PopChips, cheddar flavor, through Amazon, inspired by a good sale and thoughts of \"there must be something better\".<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the calorie count: A substantial 3oz bag of these chips (a lunch bag is 1oz) has only 360 calories (120 calories per \"serving\"), of which 35 are fat calories. Those are better numbers than tradition potato chips, which run around 160 calories for a 1oz serving, and which get 80-90 of those calories from fat. (Calorie counts can vary dramatically upward depending on the chips, but these numbers are typical). Better--and this is where the calories don't tell the whole story--a 1 oz serving feels larger, because these PopChips are puffed larger.<br /><br />But don't let that word \"puff\" scare you. They DO have a major non puffy tasting solid crunch to them. The flavor is also pretty good and the best part: Look Ma, no orange crap on my hands! That's a big plus for a cheddar flavored chip...Take that Cheetos!<br /><br />I liked the cheddar ones so much, I ordered the BBQ ones as well, and they're even better tasting (IMHO).<br /><br />One thing to note: These are low(er) fat, low(er) calories, but not low sodium. A 1oz portion has 290mg of sodium (12% of the recommended daily intake for a normal person). If you are on a salt restricted diet, or if you don't like salt, think twice...<br /><br />On the whole, these are good, tasty, and most importantly, satisfying, while at the same time less caloric (and much less fatty) than standard potato chips. They are saltier than many would prefer, but presuming you are not on a salt restricted diet, they'll be OK. As a bonus, they are supposed \"all natural\". Personally, I don't care about that last point, but it's certainly not a bad thing!<br /><br />One last thing: You will find some diets that claim it's not the calories, it's the source of the calories. Hogwash. It IS the calories. No chip is diet worthy in big quantities. Consider the calories and  your total caloric intake, and make the personal decision whether these make sense.<br /><br />Try them yourself...Amazon offers a sampler package with multiple varieties, and that might be the best way to sample them.\n",

I've been buying this at Albertsons lately and getting it 2 for $3.00 which is roughly about the same price on Amazon but of course now I won't have to pay the sales tax and I get it shipped to me via UPS 2nd Day Air for FREE since I'm an Amazon Prime member.  I just hope Amazon lowers the price as well as making this one of their Subscribe & Save products.  I just ordered 4 of the 12 packs - (1) Lemon, (1) Chocolate, and (2) Spearmint.  I'll be so happy if they lower this to around $1.00 or less per bottle.  I would then order this stuff like crazy as I hate drinking regular water and am seriously trying to get off diet sodas.<br /><br />P.S. - If you're wondering about the Chocolate flavor - it's awesome.  It sounds nasty but is actually good.  It taste a bit like your drinking water with one of those green Andes candies in your mouth.  If you're trying to cut down or even get off of sweets - this is a good water to drink as it actually satisfies your sweet cravings!!\n",

It's just the Muddy Buddies which are peanut butter and chocolate covered Chex which are then heavily dusted with powdered sugar, or confectioner's sugar if you call it that.

      "I absolutely LOVED their samosas.  There are 4 samosas in one 11-oz package.  They're really supposed to be just appetizers but after just eating 2 or 3 of them for lunch at work, I was full and I didn't feel like eating anything else.  They're HUGE - like large eggrolls folded over and stuffed with peas and potatoes in a spicy mixture and the mint chutney condiment adds a delightful complex flavor to the samosas.  I microwaved my samosas but to get the real fried texture, it's probably better to fry them in a little oil.  I have to agree with other reviewers that their samosas rival what you'll find in a really good Indian restaurant.  I've never seen them made so good and so huge and so authentic by any other indian food maker.  You may want make a type of raita with the mint chutney condiment by adding sour cream or greek yogurt or regular yogurt to it to help cool down the spicy heat from the samosas and make the chutney creamier and less liquidy.  I also usually add loose leaf lettuce/herbs and sliced cucumbers to my raita like it's a \"cooling\" salad-raita mixture.  Instead of dessert, finish your meal down while cooling down your palate with the smooth refreshing indian yogurt mango smoothie-like drink while eating your meal with <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004J1B136\">Rasna Lassi Mix Mango</a>  or  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002XHFG70\">Rellure Kesar Mango Pulp, 30-Ounce Cans (Pack of 6)</a>  which is a lot more cooling than drinking iced water or other cold drink.  It's too bad they don't have lamb samosas like they have in the indian restaurants - i LOVE lamb!<br /><br />Other wonderful products of theirs to try are their <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GOYT1O\">Tandoor Chef Chicken Tikka Masala, 10-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a> or their quite incredibly tasty biryanis <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GOYT4G\">Tandoor Chef Chicken Biryani, 10-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a> or their Masala Dosa as light appetizers <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004ZKCQL2\">Tandoor Chef Masala Dosa, 14-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a> or their very spicy tasty <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OBTYL2\">Tandoor Chef Lamb Vindaloo, 9.5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a>.\n",

Anya, a Russian Blue from the branch of PAWS in DeKalb Co, GA, is always hungry...kind of like her owner.  As usual, she tore open the bag when it didn't get put up promptly.  But, I do notice that my cat is extra enthusiastic to get to this food!  To keep from having to have two kinds of treats handy, I keep a small bottle of this within reach at all times.  The two dogs and cat eagerly do tricks for this kibble!  It doesn't hurt a dog to eat a small quantity of cat food [dogs will gain weight if they have access to a steady supply].  However, dog food on a regular basis can give a cat kidney problems.  Even though treats are probably not enough to do this, I feel safer using cat food for everybody :)<br /><br />Anya has been on this food for over a year now, and she still is just as eager during our furkid kindergarten as she was the first time I used it.<br /><br />I am a fan of Iams food because, as they advertise, the cat box doesn't smell as bad on a diet of Iams as it does with Purina [I haven't used other brands]. Also, we don't have to feed as much Iams as Purina.  Like most cats, Anya is constantly hungry, so we just feed her twice a day. The only thing I give her that is not Iams is an occasional plain piece of meat, or a taste of greens or fruit off my plate [no sauces].  Cats hate citrus, but if I'm eating an orange, she will taste a tiny grain with juice inside. Because I resist her begging, she keeps her svelte hourglass figure.  Anya has soft fur and she smells good.  I think diet has a large part to play in her health, as I believe it does with dogs.\n",

As other reviewers have said, all aspects of human health were addressed, it is very tasty with great textures. Ever since I bought my first box, the only time since then I ever buy other cereals is when U is not available. Even the box and the ink are cutting edge as far as environmental concerns. I feel good for hours after eating it, and heartily recommend it with Tempt original hemp milk for that much extra omega 3 and 6 (it tastes great with moo milk as well). The retail price when not on sale is about $4.99/box- expensive, but worth it. the bulk price is much better, and if you buy enough to get free shipping, it's a great deal.  Since U is such a wonderful product, you may not want to eat any other cereals, in which case a 4 pack will only last a couple of weeks...\n",

      "My kitties are SPINACH EATERS, THEY ARE! And they love this Purina Pro Plan Chicken, Pasta (little balls of Pasta) and Spinach...little Spinach leaves are seen here and there. My cats like this well enough that they will eat it on an every other day basis. It isn't SO GREAT that they will eat it every day, day in and day out. But, if it is on a rotation where they get it every two or three days, then they will eat it and lap it all up. I do not mind rotating the food to keep them happy. So far, it has just been a matter of figuring out what they will eat and how often then will eat it. Then, with Amazon's wonderful Subscribe and Save capability, I just order and have items shipped every one, three, four or six months. I have finally found enough foods that I am able to order these and just sit back and watch them roll in!<br />Some of the kitty favs are:1, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006TAD0B6\">Purina Pro Plan Adult Cat Food, Turkey and Cheddar Cheese Entr&eacute;e, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>2.<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CFN2O\">Purina Pro Plan Adult Cat Food (Indoor Care), Salmon and Rice Entr&eacute;e, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>(THIS SALMON IS AN EVERY DAY FOOD). 3.<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012KK4KI\">Fancy Feast Elegant Medleys for Cats, Florentine Collection with Garden Greens, 12-Count (Pack of 2)</a> 4.<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C1W8WI\">Tiki Cat Puka Puka Luau Chicken in Chicken Consomme (12/2.8oz Cans)</a>5.<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00513J4PS\">Fussie Cat Premium Chicken with Vegetables & Brown Rice - 24 - 2.82-oz.

Well, it arrived today, and he does enjoy it, but maybe a little too much. In the span of a few hours, he's managed to get an entire chunk off the smaller end. He made about as much progress on the natural bone in this time, and it was a cheaper. I think I'll probably just stick with the natural bones from now on.

I finally came back to try Stash's Chai again today and the first thing that hit me was the strong clove scent, which doesn't bother me as much after a few minutes.  I think the chai tastes a bit better this time around than when I first tried it.  Kinda grows on you, I guess.  However, it's not GREAT chai by any means.  It's okay for chai in a teabag.

I think I've found my daily brew.<br /><br />Who this coffee isn't for...<br />-Dark Coffee drinkers.  This isn't an ultra dark,oily, burnt(Starbucks drinkers I'm talking to you) roast.  It was never intended to be one.  If you make drip or French press coffee and you're used to dark roasts, this will underwhelm.<br />-Espresso snobs.  This isn't Intelligencia.  If you want Intelligencia, go buy Intelligencia.  Most of Lavazza's roasts are meant to consumed in every day situations and every day affordable coffee.  This also isn't Illy coffee and as much as I like their taste better, I do enjoy my fatter wallet.<br /><br />I'm not too big on milk based espresso drinks, so can't really give any review there.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a solid everyday Italian espresso for those looking for something reliable to drink every day.  It's forgiving enough that you don't have to make it to exacting standards with a mega dollar professional machine like some of the fancier roasts and it's not like having to slog through a can of Folgers.<br /><br />If you want Starbucks or Intelligencia, go buy Starbucks or Intelligencia.\n",

      "I bought the medium ball for my 5 year old lab mix as a Christmas gift. She's a hard core chewer so I was looking for something that would not be destroyed in one day... or in 10 minutes. She was happy to get it and plopped herself on the floor and starting chewing on the treats. It took her only 5 minutes to pop one treat out and start going to town on it. Dang, so much for the challenge. Maybe she was just lucky is what I thought, so I put the treat back in the ball and went to the bathroom to wash my hands and came back in under a minute or two and the treat was out yet again. So now I'm just letting her gnaw at the one treat which she's been at for over 15 minutes. I'm going to try buying the everlocking treats for the ball next to see if they're more of a challenge. But if that doesn't prove to last longer than 30 minutes or longer I'm not sure the whole product is worth it. For how easy the treats pop out and how expensive they are to purchase it might not be worth it in the long run. Oh well, I guess what matters the most is that my dog is happy with the ball treats or no treats.\n",

      "My dog loves these treats, at 50 lbs he is a smaller-end of the range specimen of a large breed (Standard Poodle).  Many have written here that these treats are not as good for larger breeds -- I beg to differ.<br /><br />The standard size of these treats is $8 for a 14 oz. bag.  The treats themselves are 40 cal / treat.<br />The small breed size is $6 for an 8 oz. bag, but on a per treat basis the cost is probably the same and the treats are only 7 cal / treat.<br /><br />My dog requires about 1300 cal / day, and his food is about 420 cal / cup.  So if I use the treats *meant* for a large breed to reward my dog for going to his crate before I leave the house, staying patiently while I unload the dishwasher, moving away on command from the hamburger my son drops on the floor during dinner so that he doesn't lose his food, leaving the squirrel right away to come in from the backyard when called, and one other just because I feel like it, then I have to reduce his food by an entire half cup.  If I use the small breed treats, I don't have to do anything.<br /><br />Put another way, these treats are more substantial than a tiny training treat and my dog knows it, but they are still low enough in calories to be used with some frequency for a larger dog.  They are not as long lasting as a bone or a chew, but I can give him three of them if I want to make him feel really rewarded and still only be dishing out half the calories of the larger size treat.\n",

      "As others have intimated, this salt-based spice mix is amazingly versatile and tasty.  I first tasted this product about 25 years ago on some hamburgers that my grandmother grilled out on the patio.  I have been hooked ever since.  I used to be able to find this occasionally on my local grocery store shelves, but it just became more and more scarce over the years.  I went to the manufacturers website only to find an option to mail order........what?  Sorry, but that's just not going to happen.  I was excited to find it on Amazon a while back, but it was only available from one vendor.....and they never seemed to have any in stock.  When I found the 12-pack of 8oz shakers, I immediately purchased it and gave some to my friends and family.<br /><br />How does my family use it?  Well, we love it on fried eggs....yes it's great in scrambled....but I prefer the kick it gives the fried ones.  I use it as a seasoning on all types and cuts of meat before I bake, broil, or grill.  Use it on large cuts of pork or pork tenderloin, lamb, excellent on all beef cuts like steaks and burgers, works ok on chicken breasts, but you can't be quite as liberal due to the leanness of the cut.  The more fat on/in the food, the more seasoning you can use....like most seasonings.  I've used it as a rub on chicken thighs that I barbecued and it was amazing.  We enjoy it in homemade mac and cheese as well.  I enjoy a shake or two on salads and tuna sandwiches.<br />Though the package size may be too big if you just want to try some for the first time, you can always share.  Besides, if you came to Amazon looking for seasonings anyway, there's a good chance you'll fall in love with this stuff and need a dozen yourself........you know......so you have a stash at all times.\n",

Aside from that fact (that will keep me a customer for life on its own), I also just feel great in general. I take a teaspoon in the morning and a teaspoon in the evening which i dissolve in warm water. It tastes like a bland lemonade, which is fine by me. I'm not here for the flavor, i'm here for the health benefits. My bathroom trips are more regular and my muscles don't feel as sore after I exercise. One thing I would like to note, just in case it happens for anyone else, is that the first 3 days I was getting a pain in my temple randomly throughout the day. Research has led me to believe that this was from the artificial sweetener in the raspberry lemonade flavoring. I'm not having those pains anymore, and when I order again i'll probably stick with the same flavor. I hope this helps someone else may be on the fence about it.\n",

      "I ordered the 3-oz cans of Chicken of the Sea Genova Tonno (tuna), pack of 24.  These are the smaller cans of tuna (single-serving for me).<br /><br />Until I tried these, I would only eat solid white albacore tuna (in spring water).  I've tried all the major brands, from Bumblebee to Starkist to Chicken of the Sea.  In my opinion, something has changed over the past few years to these major brands.  The solid white albacore I had been buying was often \"mushy\" and inconsistent in quality.<br /><br />After reading the reviews on the Chicken of the Sea Genova Tonno (tuna), I was skeptical, but willing to give it a try.  Since the product wasn't \"solid white albacore\" tuna, and was packed in oil (olive oil), I had a few lingering doubts.  However, at the time of my purchase, the item was on sale and there was a Chicken of the Sea promotion that lowered the price.  That was enough incentive for me to make my purchase (good move, Amazon!).<br /><br />I tried my first can the day after receiving the product, and I've enjoyed several cans since then.  THIS is how tuna is supposed to be -- how it USED to be.  It flakes beautifully; every can I've opened has had the same quality consistency with NO \"mushiness\".  The flavor is excellent, in my opinion.  I never thought I would enjoy \"non-albacore\" tuna, and now I don't think I'll ever go back.\n",

      "I'm not a tea drinker, so I'll start with that right off the bat.  However, I was reading online about some non-medication ways of coping with a stuffy nose.  One of them mentioned Mullein tea as a natural remedy to combat mucus, so I schlepped down to my local health food store to buy a box of 24 tea bags, for about a buck more than they are here on Amazon.  Not only did drinking this tea 3-4 times a day for a couple days have ZERO effect on my stuffy nose, but this was the worst cold/cough/flu I've had in about 10 years.  Obviously I can't prove that this was BECAUSE of the tea, but I am convinced that I wasted my money on this useless product, and that, at least for me, it provided absolutely no results for anything.

Oatmeal is nice, but  . . .  you know how bland that can get.  I ended up loving the candy taste without the calories, excess sugar, or unknown additives found in some cereals.  This is definitely a cereal that will agree with the palate of everyone in the family from your toddler to grandma.  Your youngster will like the bunny shapes and you can bring this cereal along as a snack for your toddler when you go out.<br /><br />For me the ingredients were the key.

      "Wilton Patterned Sugar Sheets Edible Decorating Paper -<br />Absolutely infuriated by this product. I was so excited to find the Damask pattern that exactly matched the decorations we chose for my daughter's Sweet 16 Masquerade Ball. Plus I knew I was going to have so much to do, that the sheets seemed the the perfect thing to make a beautiful cake with not much effort. I decided to simply wrap the outside of each tier and pipe a border, place a few fondant masques, and call it a day. Buying that many sheets was expensive, but I thought it would be worth it. The plan seemed to have worked perfectly UNTIL I opened the cake carriers at the banquet hall the next day to do the final stack and pipe the bottom borders. The sheets had evidently absorbed moisture from the buttercream and were all bubbled up and buckled over the entire cake. Any attempt to press them back into place resulted in the sheets sticking to my fingers and shredding away from the cake. Thankfully, the hall was dim and I had made extra fondant masques, so I was able to cover most of the damage. BUT, this was supposed to be the centerpiece of the banquet table! It ended up being relegated to a corner table, so that the worst damage was blocked from view by the wall. I don't make my living making cakes, but I have been doing it for over 30 years, so to have to present such disappointment at my own daughter's Sweet 16 party made me sick! Shame on you Wilton for producing such a shabby product!\n",

      "The vast majority of my rating for this one comes down to taste. It's a carbonated drink that tastes a bit like a fruity soda, but the sweetness is a little smoother and nicer than soda typically is.<br /><br />The big drawback here is that a 16-ounce can contains 260 calories of sugar. After some thought about how I wanted to consume this once I realized how much sugar was involved, I saved it for a day when I knew I'd be walking for several hours so that I could just drink it when I knew my body had plenty of use for the sugar. I wouldn't recommend it as a drink to have sitting down at a desk or something like that, because that's a lot of sugar to be consuming if you're not doing anything at that moment to burn through it. The company does make a sugar free version <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004MO3AUW\">No Fear, Sugar Free, 16-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>, though I haven't tasted that, so that's an option to try for those times when you want an energy drink but you won't be moving around much.\n",

At first I was confused as to what the taste reminded me of, but then I realized it reminded me of pink Necco mints. I don't drink sugar in tea, but I think if I did and I had put some in this tea it would've made it overbearing. However, after drinking this tea once every day for a week or so, I'm finding it to be almost like a chore. I love the health benefits and this tea has actually helped me feel pretty good after drinking a cup, but the taste is becoming a bit overbearing. As I mentioned early in my review, the taste is reminiscent of pink Necco mints (minus the mint part, of course) but it can be hard for me to get through a cup of it because after awhile that Necco taste begins to remind me more and more of chalk. Yes, it definitely has a chalky flavor. I will still continue to drink this tea until the box is gone but I don't think I'll be buying any more of it unless it has some sort of miraculous effect on me later on down the box.

I think I have to concede that I personally do not like the taste of olive oil. I hate to give Zoe a bad product review because of my personal likes and dislikes.

      "Being the candy-lover that I am, I wanted to buy some cute lollipops that I could pull out of my bag and enjoy whenever I felt like it. For that purpose alone, I'd give them five stars. However- at first lick, the lollipop has a slightly off taste; but this goes away after a minute and is not unbearable or disgusting in any way. I laughed quite a bit at the reviews of outraged individuals because the lollipops are 'Made in China'- I'm not dead/dying/sick. Good enough? As well, the text on the wrapper is fine- I wasn't repulsed by it and I'm not afraid to share. I'd only rewrap them if they were for presentation rather than eating.<br />The colors are not as vivid as in the picture, and the lolipops are not glazed- so they do not have that shiny look that many others have. None of mine came broken, and they were well-wrapped. I'm happy with my purchase and plan on eating them all(minus the few that I share with friends), but I'd try something different next time.\n",

      "When I found out Rockstar Juiced recently changed its formula to 10% juice, I was heartbroken. I instantly fell in love with the drink when it first came out. Its 70% juice formula was to die for. When they changed it to 50% juice, I was a little disappointed since the drink seemed a little unhealthier. However, since the difference in taste was minuscule and since 50% juice is better than no juice, I let it slide. The new Rockstar Juiced is disgusting. It is packed with more sugar and calories compared to the old version and the difference in taste is very noticeable. The after feeling I got from drinking the new one was very uneasy and unsatisfying. I was an avid drinker of Rockstar Juiced. I drank at least one per day, sometimes two. I will now have to revert back to coffee & redbull. At least I am not completely heartbroken since some of my local grocery stores still carry the 50% version. But once they are completely out, goodbye Rockstar Juiced. I will miss you.\n",

I use a little less than the recommended amount to suit my taste. I haven't noticed any real energy boost though. I'll stick to coffee if I need a caffeine jolt. As for the vitamins its infused with, I guess they can't hurt, but don't confuse Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink as something healthy. It's a zero calorie, zero carb beverage, that is sweetened with Sucralose. They also added some caffeine and vitamins, but it's probably more for marketing than anything else. If you're a fan of diet soft drinks, you'll probably like Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink. If you don't like sugar free soft drinks, then definitely look elsewhere.\n",

Part of the reason is that they are too oily (some chips almost look transparent, if you know what I mean). The taste of oil is a bit too overwhelming for me. If you are used to more spicy chips you may not like these since they do not have any spice, except salt, as the name says. I don't think I'll buy these again.

Well Fish Sauce<br />is entirely made of anchovies, and its present in many of their cornerstone dishes,<br />and is a main ingredient in dishes you woulndt even expect like Green Papaya Salad.<br /><br />OK, why am I so obsessed with anchovies?

Umami can best be characterized as a \"savory\" taste, but a<br />savory so satisfying that it lingers on your taste buds like the final chords of your<br />favorite song. This magic umami also can be found naturally in foods such as Parmesan<br />cheese, truffles, meats, mushrooms and certain fish.<br /><br />I'm guessing anchovies get such a bad rap because of the low quality extra salty versions<br />used by pizza joints and because of those oily tins you buy in the store with a 20 year<br />shelf life. LOL<br /><br />You have products on your shelf with anchovies, mainly Lea & Perrin Worcestershire.

One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not. This is called taking magnesium to bowel tolerance (just like using vitamin C to bowel tolerance.<br /><br />Almonds are a good source of Fiber.<br />One ounce contains approximately 12% of the RDA for an adult.<br />So, in summary, Almonds are a very healthy snack, so what's left to say?<br /><br />Two things:<br />1st be cautious about \"bowel tolerance\" or \"happy bowels\" if you prefer.<br />2nd Taste.

My finickiest dog never turns them down although she has turned down other brands of biscuits. The only thing that puzzles me is that the biscuits are now thinner than they used to be. They must still taste the same since my dogs still gobble them up. I had brought up this inconsistency to an Iams rep at a dog show about a year ago. His only answer was that they had 2 manufacturing companies and one must be making them thinner than the other company. I would think that their standards on this would be fairly strict so that the 2 companies would be manufacturing identical products, but apparently not. Oh well, it's not really a problem as long as my dogs remain elated with them, and since they are sold by weight there's nothing sneaky going on as far as I can tell. I love that I can order a pack of 6 on Amazon.com. Many times the stores do not have that many, so the 6-pack is really convenient since my dogs go through these pretty quickly.\n",

Luckily there's a decent amount of vanilla flavor, but it needs something else.<br /><br />The granola is mainly just whole oats, which is difficult to chew and takes awhile.  The mouth-feel isn't nearly as appealing as other granola on the market.  It doesn't really get soggy in milk, either.<br /><br />The almonds in this granola are whole, but few and far between.  While normally I like whole almonds in granola, this granola type would be much better with lots of almond slivers instead.  I think that would greatly enhance this granola.<br /><br />The flavor is mainly oats and vanilla, and both are mild.  That's why I got tired of it quickly.  I ended up mixing it into other granola to use it up.<br /><br />This is a healthy granola, with a very low sugar content, which is nice.  However, it doesn't taste good enough for me to keep buying more of.  I like other Bear Naked granola, but this one is low on my list.\n",

To be honest I dont think I am going to run out and buy more. Others have said these are a healthier option, and I'll take their word for it because I'm not a huge granola bar eater.

The lovely metal tin indeed has two lids -- the usual one over the top, and then an inner, inset metal lid sealing the leaves in.

I brewed according to directions, and uploaded a photo above to show you the gorgeous amber tea and the huge leaves, nicely plumped from the hot water.

These are probably my least favorite flavor to date. They have the lime twang you would expect and a little chili heat (though not overly spicy) and even the potato flavor comes through.

      "I am thorougly disgusted with Betty Crocker for this product (Gluten-free Bisquick), which is a shame, because I do applaud them for their excellent cake, cookie, and brownie mixes.<br /><br />I'm not upset with them for for coming out with a gluten-free baking mix, but for:<br /><br />#1) marketing it as though it's an equivalent to Bisquick and<br />#2) for pricing it so ridiculously high.<br /><br />Ingredients for regular Bisquick: Enriched flour, Partiallly hydrogenated soybean and/or cottonseed oil, leavening, dextrose, salt.<br /><br />Ingredients for gluten-free Bisquick:  Rice Flour, Sugar, Leavening (baking soda, sodium aluminum phosphate, monocalcium phosphate), Modified Potato Starch, Salt, Xanthan Gum<br /><br />Notice anything missing from the ingredients of gluten-free Bisquick? Yup, that's right--there's no shortening (or oil).<br /><br />That was the whole point of the original Bisquick--a baking mix that ALREADY HAD THE SHORTENING MIXED IN.  That avoids the longest and messiest step of baking things like biscuits  That is why people buy baking mixes--for that specific convenience.<br /><br />Betty Crocker has decided to leave out the shortening (or oil) altogether, even though shortening (or oil) is always naturally gluten-free. So they can't pretend it's a safety-for-celiacs factor.  It's a cost-savings to them, pure and simple.<br /><br />Here's the breakdown of what you're paying $5 a pound for:<br />rice flour (99 cents a pound at my local Asian store),<br />sugar ($2.88 for a 5 pound bag at Walmart) ,<br />potato starch (also 99 cents a pound at the Asian store),<br />baking powder ($3.19 a pound at Emergency Essentials),<br />salt ($2 for 26 ounces of Morton's),<br />xanthan gum ($10.45 for 4 ounce on Amazon).<br /><br />Yes, xanthan gum is expensive--but very, very little is needed; a 16-ounce box of gluten-free Bisquick would contain about a teaspoon of xanthan gum--maybe 20 cents' worth of xanthan gum.<br /><br />Betty Crocker is charging over 5 times what it would cost you to make their \"mix\" at home, while eliminating the major convenience factor (and cost to themselves, but not to you) of their regular baking mix.<br /><br />I don't mind their making a fair profit, especially if the product really WERE the equivalent of regular Bisquick.  But they're gouging us, and being misleading about the product.<br /><br />MAKE YOUR OWN, EASILY, AND FOR LESS THAN 20% OF WHAT THEY CHARGE!<br /><br />Since there's no oil in gluten-free Bisquick, you can easily stir up an equivalent, make 5 pounds (or more!) at a time, with very little effort, and it will keep for several months.<br /><br />Or, if you want a REAL Bisquick substitutes, betterbatter.org has a recipe on the site for a cup-for-cup substitute for Bisquick that DOES use shortening and non-fat dry milk powder.  Or you can use buttermilk powder, or even Vance's dairy-free powder.  It makes 10 cups at a time, stores well, and you don't have to use their gluten-free flour--you can use any gluten-free flour replacement you want (like rice flour and potato starch from your local Asian store, mixed with an appropriate amount of xanthan gum, about 1/2 teaspoon for every two cups).<br /><br />To find the recipe, do a google search of \"betterbatter Bisquick Substitute Master Mix.\"<br /><br />Boo on Betty Crocker.\n",

      "I do not understand the people who say that they cook with this product. It has a strong coconut flavor and aroma that would only be good for deserts, if you want that. I tried it in split pea soup that has a pretty strong aroma of its own, and found it quite unworkable. Also, coconut \"oil\" is one of the most saturated fats in nature, so I'd rather just use butter for most things since it is not nearly as saturated. Yes, it may not contain trans fat, but that's about all that you can say for it.<br /><br />You cannot \"eat it out of the jar\" as someone avered because it is so saturated at outside air temperatures that it is rock-hard. It may possibly work for psoriasis or as a hand cream, but remember that your body will smell strongly like coconut if you use it as a salve. I'm pretty skeptical right now, but I have two jars so I am trying some non-culinary things to use it up.\n",

      "Purchased approximately 24 of these bars in different flavors (the chocolate fudge being my personal favorite, though the brownie crunch is also tasty).  The texture is a bit chewy but the flavor is good...for a protein bar.  Not necessarily on par with the average sugar-filled candy bar of course.  The carb/sugar/protein content is on par with most higher end Gluten Free protein bars I've discovered (including Quest Bars and NoGii).<br /><br />All things considered - flavor, consistency, and quality, I'd likely give these 4 stars.  The issue, however, is that after eating about 6 bars with no issues, I began having gluten reactions to the next three I attempted to eat.  Needless to say, no matter how much protein you consume, your workouts are not going to go well if you're horribly sick.<br /><br />I have written to the company to complain, but cannot afford to take this risk, especially with other comparable bars available.  I caution anyone with Celiac Disease to try these at your own risk, they say GLUTEN FREE on the label, but something was not or a batch became contaminated.  I've been a diagnosed Celiac for over 10 years and I (unfortunately) know the reaction all too well and this bar sparked it.<br /><br />Although I wanted to support this bar for it's high protein content and GF label, I will not buy Think Thin bars again for this reason.  I've moved to Quest Protein Bars for now as I've never had any gluten or allergic reactions to those (and they tend to taste better if you like an almond/caramel type flavor) <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00418OR56\">Quest Bar 2.12 oz. Low Carb, Gluten Free, High Fiber Protein Bars (Box of 12 Bars)</a> - though you'd likely want to buy these from the actual site as they are much cheaper there.<br /><br />Otherwise, if you have no food allergies or specific dietary constraints, these might work for you...good luck!\n",

I know there are no magic pills, weight-loss suits are a scam, and the only way to lose weight is to cut calories drastically and get off the couch by walking/running and doing some weight training.<br />My problem is my appetite. Cutting calories and \"bad\" foods sounds easy but if your stomach is screaming it's NOT easy. I read about these crackers in a book, that those anorexic looking models eat these to stave off hunger. OK, I gave them a try.<br />They work for me. If I have a couple if I feel hunger coming on, with a bottle of water, it really does take that hunger away. Give it about 30 minutes. I could have skipped dinner last night from a few of these crackers in the afternoon.<br />The taste isn't awful, just bland. They are SUPER dry so have some water or coffee/tea at least with them.<br />Something about these things satisfies me and makes me less hungry. That's how I'll lose some of this weight, by not stuffing myself.<br />I'll be back here for more when I'm running out!\n",

      "Although described as a Jerky, this is a wet (clear slightly viscous liquid, just enough to make it that you need a napkin to eat it) product in a vacuum sealed pouch.  So if you are expecting a dry, crispy jerky you are likely to be disappointed.  However, the product within the pouch I found to be very tasty, and the fat portion of the bacon did have a bit of crunch associated with it, as opposed to a rubbery/fatty texture.  Great smokey/bacon flavor, reminded me more of sliced preserved bacon, as opposed to dry jerky.  I have not tried the other bacon jerkys yet to compare it.<br /><br />The delivery timing and packaging were first class.<br /><br />To sum it up:<br /><br />Pros:  Tasty, true bacon product, well packaged, great shipping including a small pack of toothpicks!  Very similar to candied bacon.<br /><br />Cons:  Product is wet, no something crispy, eat easily from a pouch or to cut up over a salad (although this would be good in one!).  Price is relatively high - to cover labor and packaging costs I'm sure.  A home consumer could make candied bacon that would be very similar at a much lower cost - but no shelf life or convenience!\n",

They all have a little bite to them that I attribute to black pepper, but aren't really spicy.  I'm not really sure if they truly taste like bacon, I have heard that the bacon flavor needs fat present to manifest itself.  I do know however, that it is so good, Ill just sprinkle some on my palm and lick it off.  Gross?  Maybe, but I bet you would lick my palm too :P<br /><br />I have never been a huge fan of either Mayo or Miracle Whip, but after trying the Baconnaise, I think my hierarchy is Baconnaise > Mayonnaise > Miracle Whip.

Its almost a religion down here)<br /><br />If you have been waiting to buy this stuff but haven't quite been convinced, just take my word for it and buy.  If you don't like it, just send it my way!

      "Let me start by saying that I am not a sweet potato fan, however, my daughter and husband are, and since we are always looking for healthier snacks, this looked like a good option. There are only 3 grams of fat in a .8 oz snack bag, so they are much better for you then regular chips and if I remember correctly, are even healthier than the regular potato popchips. Personally, I thought the chips were just OK, but my daughter and husband love them, so I averaged out our reviews to end up with 4 stars.<br /><br />When I first bit into a chip I found it intensely sweet but then quickly I tasted the salt and it formed a nice balance, though after eating several I did find them more sweet than salty overall. They are really very light and not at all greasy. If you are a fan of sweet potatoes, you will probably like these chips. If sweet potatoes aren't your thing, these probably won't sway you (they didn't for me).\n",

      "These were recommended to us at the veterinary hospital to keep our cats' teeth cleaner in between cleanings. As we've only been using them a few months, don't know if they've helped in that regard, although one of our cats has been back and the doctor said her teeth \"look good\". She had a dental three months ago, so who knows if treats had anything to do with that.<br /><br />But we do know that the \"kids\" love them. They go absolutely, hysterically crazy for them. I've never seen such a response to any treat. Our 2-year-old bats his around like a hockey puck, terrorizing it, stalking it, and finally devouring it. Our middle-aged mellow boy carefully contemplates his and eats it slowly, like he wants to savor every bit of it as long as possible. Our senior queen kitty picks hers up and carries it to a private place where she can dine by herself. Our kids are large and the size of these is no problem. At first I cut them into smaller pieces, but that turned out to not be necessary.<br /><br />I only wish they weren't so darned expensive.

The image shows the \"Vitality\" duck and sweet potato product (which I was familiar with and wanted), but what came was the \"Happy Hips\" duck and sweet potato product.  My roommate had actually purchased the \"Happy Hips\" product through the mail before and while we noticed some uneven quality, my order was disgusting.  The contents of most of the 12 cans in the cans in the first box had congealed into a super hard blob with none of the meat chunks and vegetables recognizable, and covering the top and interspersed in the contents were what looked like maggots.  I tried the can with the best looking contents, convinced myself that the white grains were rice (even though rice is not listed in the ingredients) and mixed some as usual with my dog's dry food.  When I came home from work today, my dog had thrown up twice.  I opened one of the cans in the second box just to see what was inside.  The contents of it looked much more like what I was used to, but I saw some of the \"rice grains\" on top.  That was it - I called Amazon and asked for a refund.  It's hard for me to blame Dogswell because I have liked their products for so long, but either on their end or the seller's, a BAD product is being distributed!  I won't be able to bring myself to try this project again for a long time, if ever.\n",

      "I had done quite a bit of research before I chose a dog food for my dogs and this seems to be the best for the money for what I needed. I needed something that would benefit different age stages nutritionally, in bulk, for the best price. This is what I based my research on and came up with this dog food. One of my dogs, full grown and used to eating different brands of junk before I knew what I was feeding him, was not too fond of it at first but got used to it and now he eats it without any issue. My puppy loves it and will overstuff herself if I do not ration for meal times. It gives me peace of mind that they both are getting what they need and I am not going broke giving it to them. My only complaint is the horrid flatulence this dog food seems to give them. I have never experienced that with my adult dog in the 4 years he's been with me but then again he has always eaten the store brands of dog food so maybe that's the issue? Overall, I am satisfied and can live with the occasional unpleasantness for a few seconds if it means they are eating healthy. There is also a NOTICEABLE difference in their coats and health. So that's another plus. I couldn't in good conscience give it five just because the flatulence really is 'room clearing'.......S'pose that could have it's uses for unwanted guests on the bright side.\n",

My son seems to think they're terrific and pursues them with almost the same vigor as he does his yogurt melts (also by Happy Baby).<br /><br />My only real complaint is the package itself-- the top pops open really easily. I had one open in my checked luggage on a trip once (oh that was fun), then another time when I had a container in the diaper bag for the day (two separate containers, so it was not just one faulty package).

The fact that you mix it up as you go (which takes, literally, no more than 15 seconds) is a great help for people like me who sometimes like to settle down with a jar of peanut butter and a spoon, only to realize a zillion calories later what I have done.  You can control the texture by adding or subtracting the water recommended.  There's plenty of peanut flavor and they've added a bit of sugar (I assume to offset the lack of fat) but it is a very small amount and still adds far less in calories than all that subtracted fat and oil.<br /><br />The chocolate PB2 is also completely awesome.  I eat it straight and it's almost like chocolate mousse.  Sometimes I pop in a little regular PB2 if I'm not wanting it so sweet but any way you mix it, it rocks.<br /><br />I ordered and received $100.00 worth and I love the comfort of knowing my PB2 is there for the forseeable future.<br /><br />I hope that the word gets out to all the people who will love this product.<br /><br />Give it a try, you won't be sorry!

It's a little on the sweet side; perhaps too sweet for some; great for others.  Popchips (any variety) are not quite as hard or crunchy as regular potato chips, but that seems like a plus to me.  They have a nicer consistency than potato chips.  I have tried other varieties of Popchips too and I like them all.  This one is of the more interesting flavors and it is sure to be a big hit.  Popchips are far less greasy than regular chips because they are not fried in fat.  Not sure of the exact process, but the result is a wonderful chip that I prefer to regular chips.  I wouldn't call these healthy, but certainly better to eat than regular greasy chips.<br />I would eat Popchips all the time over other chips, except that the bags are small and they are a bit more expensive than other chips.  The extra you pay for these is worth it if you like this style of chip.  I can't imagine anyone not liking Popchips, although perhaps not everyone would like this flavor.

All of those attributes are nice but wouldn't be so important if the dog didn't like them. Our dog, who gets lots of small, bite-size treats as part of his continuing training, gets tired of diced sausage-shaped moist food from the pet store and cut-up franks from the grocery, but he'll run a mile for a liver treat! I do wish they were smaller and/or less expensive. We usually cut them in quarters with a sharp knife to make them last longer.\n",

Lotus Foods Madagascar Pink Rice was described as having a hint of spice flavor such as cinnamon or clove.  I didn't pick up on that in the slightest.  In fact, this rice had very little flavor at all.  I normally buy brown basmati rice, or Lotus Foods Forbidden Rice which are fantastic all by themselves.  Those rices can be enjoyed without a speck of salt or other seasoning added.  The Madagascar Pink can't begin to compare.<br /><br />I wish this had been available in a small package instead of an 11 pound sack.  I read the full description on the Lotus Foods website and I liked the idea of this rice.  The Amazon subscription price was a great deal, so I went for it.  I'll still eat the rice, of course, but it will be served in recipes that don't depend on the rice for flavor like other whole grain rices provide.\n",

      "Not familiar with what \"chai\" tea is supposed to taste like but this tea tasted like stewed cloves to me  Yuck.Got this flavor in a sampler box and, so far, it's the only Stash tea I've tried and disliked strongly. Some are better than others, of course, but I find this particular flavor really, really unpleasant, which is odd given my love for most of the spices listed on label.  The problem is that the clove just overwhelms everything and that's about all I could taste, outside a touch of cinnamon. IMO, clove has much too strong a taste to be used beyond sparingly...in anything. Perhaps adding milk and sugar might've made it more palatable - might even be the way it's 'supposed' to be prepared, but one of the reasons I drink tea is to stay away from having to add sweeteners or milk to make it taste good. In any case, I can't imagine using enough milk/sweetener to subdue the overwhelming clove taste would leave any room in the mug for tea or water.\n",

I was pleased to discover that the chai spice was not overwhelming and I thoroughly enjoyed my first cup of Higgins & Burke Chai Black Tea.  I also like the box as it has the punch-out section at the bottom so that all of the tea bags don't fall out at once...always a nice feature for single dispensing.<br /><br />My next cup of tea had an extremely strong taste of cinnamon.  Now, I like cinnamon but this was even too strong for me!  I found the next few tea bags to be inconsistent in flavor.  Sometimes they were good,and sometimes the flavors were too overpowering.  I tried the tea both hot and iced.

The dogs loved them! In fact I went to my front door to get the box and normally my dogs don't get excited about boxes. But this time I guess they could smell the treats inside because they both went crazy! I'll say that the box is bigger then I expected, contains approx 16 biscuits. The \"serving size\" on the box I'm not sure about as it says \"for best results give 2 twice a day. If my math is right they want you to feed your dog a total of 4 of these a day and at that rate the box will last 3 and a half days.  If the treats were healthier and not so much filler I wouldn't see a problem with this IF it really helps the teeth, but with it being mostly filler I couldn't see feeding my dogs 4 of these every day. They are a good treat every now and then, but certainly not to be used as an on-going dental treatment because you would go through 2 boxes a week and at the current price it would be about $48 a month and that is just for 1 dog. These in my opinion are purely TREATS and not dental supplements. I will be submitting a picture of my dogs with these treats if you would like to see how excited they were when I got them out! I rated these at 3 out of 5 simply because of the healthiness of these compared to the \"recommended serving.\" As far as my dogs go, I think they would give it a 5.\n",

      "I'm a big tea drinker and am always looking for different flavors and varieties to try. Blackberry Vanilla is an aromatic combination; this tea is that and a flavorful drink, too. I steeped one tea pyramid in a cup of hot water for eight minutes (the box recommends six) and was surprised by the beautiful color and nice flavor: not too overwhelming taste of blackberries with vanilla sailing in after the first sip. This also makes a great iced tea.<br /><br />The biggest concern I had was when I read the ingredients on the side of the box. Like a previous reviewer said, the first ingredient is hibiscus--for a blackberry vanilla tea. How strange.<br /><br />Good for any occasion.\n",

I was on vacation out of town when I purchased this at a drugstore so I can't even return it for a refund.  I will NEVER buy this product again.

I gave a negative review on Kool-aid's packaging of this product for another flavor, because I felt it was ridiculous, especially since you get two separately packaged boxes of Kool-Aid, which means they could sell them separately, if they chose to. I consider the price and the way a product is sold to be just as important as the product itself, so I'll leave that review there. That being said, I broke down and bought this flavor since I love Mango so much.  You'll love it even more when added to the pina-pinneaple flavor also sold on Amazon. Oh yeah, you'll have to buy 96 packs of those as well. Good luck finding these flavors in your stores.  I have no idea why my three favorite flavors (this one, the lime and the pina-pinneaple) are not to be found anywhere near me.  I live in la and you would think a product called \"Aguas Frescas\" could be found close, no? Anywho, you'll love the flavor and so long as you're willing to drink it for a couple years, it's worth the price.

When I read it was a \"collectors\" edition, I assumed more care would be taken in the packaging and the packaging itself would be special. Instead it's just a print that they put in with the coffee -- it's a black and white print that isn't any better quality than your regular poster.  The coffee itself is as described (although there are so many \"bold\" flavors that I'm not sure how they can claim this is a medium roast collection).  If you are looking to sample different brands and types of coffee, this works.

      "I have two dogs, but only one of them eats Cesar chicken \"in meaty juices\" (it HAS to be the \"in meaty juices kind!) and she GOBBLES IT. after years of searching for a food she'll eat to enjoy, not just eat to survive, we've finally found a winner!<br /><br /> Gigi is a 9-year-old Papillon mix who is both dainty, firecely independent, and plain fierce when she's disturbed, while 1-year-old Mini-Dachshund Sophie is a happy, bouncy, and utterly addicted to attention. Gigi spends her time under the bed, Sophie is wherever I am. What Sophie eats is actually still TBD. This is Gigi's review.<br /><br />Both of them have been picky eaters. Gigi went years on starving herself until she couldn't hold out any longer, then deigning to eat the dry food we supply between wet food dinners, even as we tried all kinds of different foods to tempt her. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012KH02I\">Beneful Dog Food Prepared Meals Beef Stew Dog Food, 10-Ounce Plastic Containers (Pack of 8)</a> used to work now and then, and though it was expensive, we could get 3 servings from it. However, even though it had a lid, it would often grow moldy even before the next meal. So even though she liked it, it was wasted and really too expensive anyway.<br /><br />When Sohpie arrived, we'd been serving <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CJF62Y\">Mighty Dog Hearty Pulled-Style Chicken Dinner In Gravy, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> with the longest sustained success yet, about a year. Only chicken, mind you, and it had to be the chunky in sauce kind, NOT the pate kind. Well, along came the puppy, and Gigi expressed her distaste by wasting food again.<br /><br />Finally, I've found Cesar. And oddly, now it has to be the pât&eacute; kind, I.e. \"in meaty juices\" NOT the chunky kind! But AT LAST we've found a dog food that The Mrs. will absolutely SNARF ON. She doesn't come up for air when I put any chicken-based \"in meaty juices\" Cesar dinner in front of her, which I cube into bite sizes.<br /><br />The added bonus is that I can hide pills in the cubes. Gigi's been diagnosed with congenital heart failure, and she's on 3 different pills, 3 times a day. Dinner is the easier dose, because I just push the little pills into the soft pât&eacute;, and she's none the wiser because she swallows the cubes almost whole! Sadly, we won't probably have Gigi with us for the fourteen or fifteen years I've been blessed to have spent with my previous dogs. But I'm determined to make sure she's as healthy and happy as possible in the time we have. She may be feisty, prickly, and a loner, but when I *can* catch her, she does love to snuggle with her mama.<br /><br />Cesar \"in nearby juices\" dog food might just give me a few month's more snuggled than we'd otherwise have.\n",

There was NO leaking at all and I have used 10 cups already.  I also read that the coffee does not seem to be as strong as regular brew.  That is true, probably due to the type of grind.  My resolution to the issue is to have a regular coffee cup in place, but choose the smallest cup on the Keurig, which gives you roughly half a cup of coffee.  Lift the handle as though you are going to remove the kcup and just push it back down and brew a second tiny cup into the already brewed cup.  Viola!  Perfect.

Besides being gluten-free, these are also wheat-free and dairy-free. Most of the ingredients are also organic.<br /><br />The shape and size is almost like a cookie, and the consistency is soft, so if you like harder granola bars, you might not like these.  The oat and coconut tastes are dominant to me, and the chocolate taste is a bit lighter.  The chocolate chunks are also not too large, which I like since it means that I can keep these on hand in my car or purse, without having to worry about them melting.<br /><br />As for nutritional facts, each bar has 180 calories, 9 grams of fat (13% of your daily value), with 2 grams coming from saturated fat.  There are 23 grams of carbs, 2 grams (10% of daily value) of fiber, and 8 grams of sugar.

      "I have been buying Lemonade in the 2 quart bottles and at 1.25 to 1.69, it was getting too expensive. So shopping one day I saw Kool-aid on sale at 15 cents a packet, at that price I bought 3 packets, looking at the ingredents it had real lemon pieces in it. So I bought 5 pounds of sugar at 2.19, as you have to add sugar to the contents.<br /><br />My Recipe is<br /><br />pour contents of one packet in a 2 cup glass measurer, add 1 1/4 cups of sugar enough water to make thin syrup, save a couple 2 quart bottles, pour contents in to bottle and add water to about 9/10 full, cap and shake. Add about 1 ounce or 2, of fresh lemon juice, to add a little tartness. I use however Sicilia lemon juice which is not from conentrate, and to me better than lemon juice, (I add just a squirt), because they also add the oil of the lemon. WOW! now you have great lemonade 10 times better than any bottle stuff or condense powder stuff. If you want pink lemonade, I just add a squirt of Strawberry syrup. Your cost for 2 quarts of the best lemonade you can drink is just about 30 cents. I just couldn't believe that KOOL-AID, made such a great product. Please try it, I find that a added quarter<br /><br />of cup of sugar, makes a big difference, and so a squirt of lemon juice. The only lemon juice I use now is Sicilia, which you should fine in the produce section, I advise not to use Real lemon(in no way is it real lemon) as it is from concentrate and has that preservative taste. Enjoy you won't be sorry!\n",

      "We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years, the other four in the 9-11 year range.  The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck.\n",

      "*****<br />This Simply Decaf Green Tea from Yogi Tea is a plain and simple, but far from ordinary green tea. The taste is incredible! It is definitely the best green tea I have ever tasted---green tea as it always should be---full of flavor and freshness! It is hard to believe there is no caffeine, as this tea tastes so pure and flavorful.<br /><br />I am definitely impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Simply Decaf Green Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site, yogitea.com, is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />This tea is 100% organic and is intended to enhance the immune system and to fight fatigue by providing antioxidants, according to Yogi Tea. Note that Yogi makes a Simply Green Tea, too, that contains 58mg of caffeine (compared to 90mg in an 8oz cup of coffee), if you are open to caffeine. Either way, you can't go wrong.<br /><br />Highly recommended. In the case of this tea, simplicity is bliss!<br />*****\n",

      "This milk contains carrageenan. Carrageenan is a type of sugar which is found in seaweeds, and generally used to make the milk thicker and creamer. Although it is largely used in food, there are growing concerns about its safety (see: [...] and the body of scientific work published by Dr. Joanne K. Tobacman)<br /><br />There is a big dispute going on about carrageenan's safety. However, for me, it suffices to say that carrageenan is \"the\" drug of choice to induce inflammation on mice ears, whenever scientists want to test for anti-inflammatory agents.<br /><br />The fact that it can induce such a powerful inflammation process, plus all the recent scientific work showing evidences that long term use of carrageenan is harmful to our gastrointestinal system , are enough for me to avoid using it myself. Imagine then, using it on my children!!!<br /><br />I wrote to Organic Horizons asking why they used carrageenan on their milk for children, and I got an answer saying that \"silk soy milk\" was safe, and bla, bla, bla. Apparently, their customer service representative didn't even bother to replace the \"silk soy milk\" for \"chocolate milk\". They probably receive so many of these inquires that they don't even bother to personalize the answers any more.<br /><br />Well, I am not buying this product anymore and decided to post this review because I think more people should know about carrageenan and decided for themselves, whether they want to consume it or not. I believe carrageenan shouldn't be used in food anymore. Especially on those claiming to be organic and targeting our CHILDREN. I am switching to Organic Valley.\n",

      "My baby girl just started eating solid foods in the last week at just under 6 months old. She has been eyeing our food and watching us intensely when we are eating. When she started trying to grab food off our plates, we knew she was ready to start eating.<br /><br />We skipped cereal all together and this was the second food that she tried after squash. I tasted a bit before giving it to her because I was curious about how strongly she would be able to taste the broccoli and spinach through the pear. While you can taste the greens, the pear mellows the flavor just enough. It isn't so sweet from the pear that baby will get used to sweet flavors though.<br /><br />The texture is perfect for her at this stage too. It isn't so thick that she has trouble with it but gives her more texture than something thinned out a lot with formula.<br /><br />Overall, I'm not crazy about the pouches. They don't stand up easily on my pantry shelves and I worry that they could be damaged or leak if I were carrying them around in a diaper bag. I do like that the cap goes back on since one pouch says it is two servings. Unfortunately, the packaging also makes it difficult to know when you have squeezed half of the food into the bowl.<br /><br />I think this is also pretty expensive. We purchased another organic baby food product in a similar pouch today that was less expensive, even before the coupon, and offered similar flavor choices.<br /><br />So my overall rating would be 5 stars for the taste and that it is made with organic ingredients but 3 stars for packaging and price.\n",

There are 2gm sugar, 10 calories and 2gm of carbs per packet (it is listed as 1/2 packet per serving, but that is unrealistic). One packet makes about 16oz prepared. Each box comes with 10 packets. The packets are made with real tea leaves and sweetened with honey. This mix does not contain Aspartame, it is sweetened with honey and Sucralose (equivalent of Splenda). The Strawberry Acai flavor is decaffeinated.<br /><br />Full Ingredient List: Honey Granules (Sugar, Honey), Malic Acid (Provides Tartness), Decaffeinated Green Tea Powder, Hibiscus Extract, Maltodextrin (Corn), Sucralose (Sweetener), Natural Flavor, Strawberry Juice Solids, Acai Juice Solids<br /><br />As far as taste goes, it has a really nice and sweet Strawberry flavor with a hint of honey. I personally can't taste the Acai. I also verily taste the tea. It is more of a strawberry drink with a slight tea and honey flavor. It is really good. However, if you are expecting lightly flavored tea, this one is not for you. It is also on the sweet side. I personally prefer sweet drinks and it is perfect for me. If you prefer your drinks not as sweet, plan on adding more water.<br /><br />I definitely like this flavor and will buy more. I do wish it had caffeine, but I can stick to this in the evening hours. It makes a nice alternative to water.

I sent a comment to Amazon to have this issue fix but nothing was said or have any items replace. When we order items we will like for ALL the items get to location as it is shown on the computer. We do understand that we cannot control shipping companies but customer service should look into answering wend there is a problem with a shipment. Thank you for not doing anything to fix this issue.

      "Well before I talk about the product quality, I'll mention that DreamFields has kicked their customers right in the wallet. I bought a case of this recently, and at first I thought the box had a leaked in shipping. Then I took a closer look, and saw that the box now said 13.25oz. That's right, an 18% (EIGHTEEN PERCENT)  price increase slipped in low and sneaky.<br /><br />Now let me make one thing clear, I like this product. I'd have to be a fool to pay three times the cost of regular pasta if I didin't! However, playing games with packaging and value is simply not an honest way to deal with customers. And while I know companies need to make a buck, I don't like them being stealth about a price increase. I especially don't like it when I'm trying to budget what I spend like everyone else in this lousy economy. And I do not appreciate being duped out of 18% of my purchase.<br />If Dreamfields feels they need a price increase (even though wheat and gasoline are actually lower in price) the just do it. If you're affraid you'll alienate customers by doing so, then cut costs. But don't be sneaky about it!<br /><br />Product taste and quality gets 5 stars<br />Product value for the money gets 2 stars\n",

The larger sized packs generally offer better value. Although prices on Amazon do fluctuate over time, as of the time of writing, this 12-pack will wind up costing you just a fraction of a cent over $1.66 a bar. Weirdly, despite the general \"more is cheaper\" principle, currently the 6-pack offers significantly better value at under $1.40 a bar. Freaky.

      "I tried to change my review to 4 stars, but I don't seem able to do that.  These are 3 oz cans of 4 different flavors of fish based catfood.  Chicken and rabbit are often more recommended for cats.  The first ingredient is fish broth, making it somewhat high in moisture.  I've heard that cats often need more water than they drink, so I'd assume its a good thing to get more moisture down them, but this is an expensive way to do it (you could just add a little water to their food).  The good news is that there appears to be no grains in the ingredient list, looks like almost all meat based (except for the usual additives).  The grains in most catfoods are thought to not be good for the cats.  This catfood is not cheap, but it appears to be a better than usual cat food.\n",

I usually mix a bit of Cesar's wet food for small dogs in with dry food, just for a little taste. I still do but have found that (unlike other dry food I tried) he will actually eat \"Solid Gold\" by itself!<br />He only eats until full. Since I don't have to worry about overeating I oven put down a bowl of dry food if I'm on the phone, running late, whatever - just in case. It makes me feel better to know he's not eating out of choice. I mean if he's willing to wait for the good stuff, fine but at least I know he's got something to eat and won't go hungry if something delays me too long. He never eats it. To my surprise, with Solid Gold, I hear often hear crunching going on and realize he is actually eating dry food!<br />I definitely recommend \"Solid Gold\".

      "Zeus, my 11-year old, 120# Alaskan malamute is fussy about treats. He approaches all treats with suspicion. And cinnamon spice is not exactly his favorite flavor. He prefers chicken or salmon. Even though these contain chicken and natural chicken flavor they smell like cinnamon and nutmeg. I assumed he would turn up his nose. I set a treat stick at his feet. He ignored it for several minutes so I figured that was that. When I turned my back he started eagerly chewing on it. He devoured it. He begged for more. He loved it! Hey Pep&eacute;! Pep&eacute; is my 2-year old Chihuahua/mini-dachshund. He'll eat anything. I cut one in half for him. He was thrilled. He also loved it. But I knew he would.<br /><br />These treat sticks contain really healthy ingredients like brown rice flour, organic quinoa flour, oat fiber and oat groats. I had to look up FOS - aka fructooligosaccharide. It's a probiotic, which is great. However FOS can cause gas, bloating, and intestinal discomfort. So I recommend one treat per day for large dogs and one half per day for small dogs. My dogs like these treat sticks so much I just set up the subscribe and save for the small and large, low cal for each dog. It's a good deal.\n",

      "I was looking for a kibble to replace the Innova I'd been feeding for many years (the change had nothing to do with quality and everything to do with not wanting to support factory farming and inhumane slaughtering practices).  Orijen 6-fish was the best I could find, short of switching my \"domestic wolves\" to a vegetarian diet.  I've been impressed how easily the dogs have adapted to it.  I started them on a 50% mix of Orijen-Innova, which is a quicker introduction than is usually recommended for new food.  They never had a bad poo, never had stomach aches.  They like the kibble so much that one started guarding the closet where it's stored.  I had to put the bag in an airtight storage can to stop that behavior.  Both dogs used to nibble grass after eating Innova, and they don't do that any more.  They are bright- eyed and energetic.  They aren't as gassy as they used to be.<br /><br />I should note that my dogs are young -- 7 months and 1.5 years.  I would not recommend feeding such a high protein kibble to an old dog (\"old\" depends on the breed).<br /><br />I found a company that delivers this at a discount if you agree to schedule regular deliveries.

      "I received the package today, purchased directly from the Pure Alaska Salmon Company.  The product itself was shipped with additional informational about salmon fishing and sustainability, as well as recipes.  There was also a postcard with a photograph of the fishing boat.  My daughter (6) helped open the package and decided to try some salmon right out of the can.<br /><br />I normally love canned right out of the can but she doesn't usually eat it straight.  I was a little hesitant as the product is a bit pricier than most commercially available products.  But I gave in and we opened two cans.  She ate the entire can and absolutely loved it.  She started asking questions about how they package salmon and we had a great discussion about salmon fishing, comparing it mostly to our experiences trout fishing here in Utah.  She made the comment about how much better this salmon is than the \"salmon mush\" we bought previously at the store.<br /><br />I have tried several other brands of salmon and this was by far the best.  A few observations made about the two cans we have thus far opened.  Obviously catch will vary so I don't expect every can to be the same.  I don't want genetically modified salmon that every one is identical.  The fish in the cans were smaller, as there were actually two steaks in each can.  The cans were clearly marked Wild Alaska Salmon on the cans themselves, unlike some salmon products that are labeled Alaska salmon, product of China (or Thailand, or Pakistan, or wherever).  This indicates the fish were caught and processed in Alaska.<br /><br />I believe it is a little odd to have fish caught in Alaska frozen, shipped to some remote processing facility, thawed, processed, and then shipped half way around the world again.  As I opened the cans of course there was a fishy smell, but not the same as the bad, icky, fishy smell that makes you want to wear a gas mask.  The flavor was perfect.  My daughter said it was very similar to tuna, and I agree.  I could imagine this would be a great enhancement to traditional tuna recipes.\n",

      "It must be true because it says so on the package: \"America's Favorite Cake.\"<br /><br />I seem to remember a check box on the 2010 Census regarding cake preference, but I don't think I voted for Yellow Cake. I would have voted for Devil's Food Cake, although it may be politically incorrect these days to mention, you know, The Devil, so I may have voted for German Chocolate Cake, but Germany is, you know, the Old Europe, so I  may have voted for a chocolate cupcake. But without peanuts because so many people are now allergic to peanuts that they can't even serve 0.5 grams of salted nuts on airplanes. Sigh.<br /><br />Where was I? Hmmm? Oh, yes....<br /><br />I certainly would vote for Duncan Hines cake but I feel it should be mentioned that this is not cake.....yet. This is cake mix.<br /><br />Its sort of a cake fetus, or a cake stem cell. It still needs lots of development. You have to add additional ingredients and warmth and time to develop the mix into a cake. There is the promise of cake, but unless you follow the protocol written on the box very carefully, you may not get cake. Depending on what you do, you may get something very odd and rubbery or something very dark and charred.<br /><br />It's complicated!<br /><br />Amazon has allowed third-party vendors to offer Duncan Hines Cake Mixes for sale for quite some time. An example of this is: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002IMS5K\">Duncan Hines Classic Yellow Layer Cake Mix 18.25 oz - 6 Unit Pack</a>. Amazon, being a very clever retailer, has obviously read the numerous, highly enthusiastic customer reviews for this product, and has now started selling these products directly to its customers, so many of whom must be begging for a six pack of a product readily available in any supermarket or convenience store.<br /><br />In order to enhance customer demand, Amazon's copywriters have outdone themselves listing this product's outstanding features:<br /><br />-Pack of six, 16.5 18.25 ounces each (now 1.75 oz. lighter!)<br />-The moistest, most delicious<br />-A special treat for the special people<br /><br />Of course, \"the special people\" must be those who voted for Duncan Hines Yellow Cake Mix. That's why it's \"America's Favorite Cake\". Makes perfect sense. This is a Democracy! This is a great country and this is great cake mix!<br /><br />Another thing you should know is that you get six boxes of cake mix. This is enough mix to incubate a very, very big sheet cake that would require a very, very large incubator or oven. You could also prepare a tall 12 layer cake which would kind of look like a miniature version of the Coit Tower in San Francisco. Certainly enough \"the moistest, most delicious\" yellow cake for a very large number of \"the special people\".<br /><br />Finally, a charming aspect is that on the very same page as this product, Amazon suggests \"Customers Who Bought This Product Also Bought\": Cottonelle Fresh Flushable Wipes, Refills, Case of 4 / 84s (336 ct). Obviously, \"the special people\" anticipate getting down with this cake. Six boxes of cake mix is bound to make a mess in the kitchen and later on, there will be cake crumbs on lips and chins and fingers.<br /><br />A few Cottonelle Fresh Flushable Wipes could come in handy!<br /><br />Smart!\n",

      "I love Primal Spirit Jerky.  I've tried several different flavors and some appealed more than others but, as a previous reviewer noted, that was more personal taste than because of any deficiency in product.  This is a very tasty snack that you can really sink your teeth into.  My sister used to buy me these at the end of a long day teaching middle schoolers and even on those days when I had skipped lunch (and breakfast) these snacks were very satisfying and so delicious that I was always happy to eat them.  Some of them are made from soy and some are made from seitan which is somewhat more chewy and stringy a food.  My preference is for seitan but surprisingly the soy was also very chewy and certainly very good.  I'm really glad the hikers who founded Primal Spirit went ahead with developing this product and I agree with them wholeheartedly that the meat-alternative foods outside the United States are generally much better and more varied and their product has benefited from that history of good vegetarian food in Asia.  Definitely going to order some of these now...Yum!\n",

      "Had been a 5 hour energy drinker for a while and was getting reoccurring shipments but the cost just kept going up.  These definitely don't have quite the same kick as 5 hour but the lasting energy feels about the same to me and for half the price, I can't beat it.  They taste smoother too, less tart.  I don't get any edgy feeling from drinking a whole bottle. I usually take half early in the day then half again before working in the evening and they keep me going.  Though, I have found that with any energy drink, if you are exhausted, they aren't going to keep you up like caffeine pills or heads up (ephedrine) but for maintaining focus during work, they work for me.\n",

      "I've seen advertisements for 5 Hour Energy products for months now, and I finally gave in yesterday.  I purchased two 2-packs of it at my local grocery store, intent on trying one out in the morning in order to wake myself up early.  First of all, these are grossly overpriced.  At the store, a 2-pack sells for $6.  You can buy a huge coffee drink for the price of one of these little 2-ounce bottles (I don't drink coffee, but I'm just giving that as an example).  Even with the \"discounts\" that are offered through Amazon or the various third-party sellers, they're still overpriced.<br /><br />Now, I'll detail what happened this morning when I tried a 5 Hour Energy for the first time:<br /><br />By the time I'd gotten up the nerve to open the bottle and drink the contents, I was basically awake.  So it did, in fact, manage to wake me up, but not in the way I was expecting.  The first thing I noticed as the liquid touched my tongue was the taste.  The awful taste.  It was like a super-saturated sugar solution, only the sweet taste had been replaced with a terrible bitter sensation that has stuck with me almost two hours after consuming the drink.  So if you enjoy having a terrible taste stuck in your mouth, even after flushing your mouth out with water and even brushing your teeth, this may be the product for you.  Otherwise, steer clear.<br /><br />The second thing I noticed was that, contrary to its advertisement, it DID NOT give me an energy boost whatsoever.  I still had to drag myself out of bed like I do every day.  Even now, nearly two hours after consuming this awful liquid, I am not filled with energy.  I did, however, feel an elevated heart rate shortly after consumption, and I do feel a little jittery right now.  I'm also finding myself a little more irritable than I usually am in the mornings, and it's difficult to concentrate on even writing this review.  I think it may have even given me a stomachache.<br /><br />So, for those of you who want a bullet point summary, here you go:<br /><br />Cons<br />----<br />Awful taste that doesn't go away<br />Grossly overpriced even with the discounts that online retailers have<br />Doesn't actually give you energy<br />Possible elevated heart rate upon consumption<br />Jitters<br />Inability to concentrate<br />Might make you irritable<br />May cause stomachaches<br /><br />Pros<br />----<br />If you're tired of carrying all that money around, this could be a great way to make your wallet or purse a little lighter.<br /><br />Simply put (if you don't feel like reading the Wall of Text up above), DO NOT buy this product.  It is, by far, one of, if not THE, worst products I've ever purchased in my life.  And I've bought a lot of junk.  Don't buy into the false advertising.  Stay away.  This stuff should be banned.\n",

I was wrong, this mochi has a nice \"nutty\" or \"toasted\" flavor. The texture is excellent, when you bake or fry  mochi it becomes chewy on the inside and crispy on the outside. I tried the mochi baked which was very good, I made mochi crust pizza- I almost liked it better than regular pizza and I attempted to make zanzai, however I think that you need white mochi for that recipe because the brown rice mochi didn't hold up as well.

      "Ok, I have to start by saying that I love Thanksgiving!  That is because I love that you can get so many pumpkin things at this time of year.  For one month I get to indulge on pumpkin flavored everything!  Then I have 11 long months of waiting for companies to bring out the pumpkin again!  And let me tell you, I overload myself so much on pumpkin that I'm ready for it to end.  That only lasts about a month before I'm craving pumpkin things again.  SO, that is why I just HAD To order the Pumpkin Pie Matcha from Red Leaf.  I'm hoping that they'll keep this flavor around and not just have it available in the fall.<br />I really wasn't quite sure how I wanted to prepare this the first time.  I opened this matcha and got a cloud full of heavenly pumpkin spices.  I put it into a tin to keep it fresh but I doubt that it'll stay there for very long.  The small size fits perfect in the tin with a little wiggle room...enough to be able to get the measuring spoon in.<br />I decided to prepare this matcha as a latte with warm milk.  I heated up 10oz of milk on the stove and then used my frother to create foam.  I then added the matcha and whisked the latte....finishing off with another round with the frother.  This matcha was very smooth.  I think the milk really complimented it well and made it taste just like a pumpkin pie!  This was so good that I don't think I want to prepare it any other way.  I think it needs the milk to take it to the next level.  To get your own tasty Pumpkin Pie Matcha from Red Leaf Tea - GO HERE NOW!!!!<br />[...]\n",

Not really ketchup and not quite barbecue, this tastes wonderful as a spicy swap-in for either of those condiments.<br /><br />The heat is nowhere near enough to register with chile-heads, but is quite noticeable (and as such people who dislike spicy foods should pass). More prominent is the smoky chipotle flavor, which is reason enough to have meat three meals a day. I rarely use ketchup or BBQ anymore but that I'm tempted to use this instead.\n",

When I opened the pouch, the vanilla smell was definitely there, and I thought this would be smooth, delicious coffee. After brewing a pot, I really couldn't taste the vanilla at all, and the coffee tastes just like the usual Starbucks fare -- strong and a little bitter. I sweetened it, I put some milk in it -- still not very pleasant. If you like Starbucks coffee, you'll probably like this, but don't expect to get the vanilla flavor.\n",

After reading other reviews I decided buying 3 pounds was not a big risk.<br />I knew not having a meat slicer was going to be a challenge but I also knew that \"practice makes perfect\".<br />The flavor is different from what I considered to be the best of pepperoni I had tried, but I have not tried any that may have been considered gourmet quality, and I like it. It is oilier but I don't consider it excessively oily.<br />The bottom line is that if you enjoy preparing pizza from home you should try this Bridgford pepperoni.

If you decide to try this product, get some True Lemon or Lime, True Orange, stevia packets (with a high level, 90% or better, of steviosides for cleaner,sweeter flavor, and a bottle of cherry snow cone syrup if you like cherry cola.  I use a half packet of lemon and Orange, 1 packet of stevia, and a short squirt of cherry per liter bottle. Now the flavor falls between generic and brand name.  Cheaper than using cans, but not cheaper than using two liter bottles.  The calorie count is about a third of normal cola.

It ranks as one of the worst things I have ever put in my mouth -- and that's saying a lot.<br /><br />The first experience is not awful -- a pleasant crispiness to it, almost reminiscent of a Rice Krispies treat, but no flavor.  Oh, if only it remained flavorless.  Instead, my taste buds were assaulted with anti-flavor.  It took every ounce of self-control to not immediately spit the product onto the floor.  Overwhelming bitterness with notes of burned vegetation and industrial products flooded every synapse devoted to taste impulses.  As I chewed the flavor intensified, and the texture disintegrated into a strange, grainy pulp.  Anyone who finishes a bar must fight against their baser instincts; nothing about these bars resembles a food product in any way.<br /><br />These bars are, quite simply, not fit for animal consumption.  If I saw a person feed a Simply Bar to a starving dog, I'd call the ASPCA.  I can only hope that the other reviewers gave this product 5 stars as a cruel, well-orchestrated joke, and not as a sincere reflection of what they think food should taste like.  But what kind of person thinks that it is funny to inflict psychic pain on a person they will never meet, and whose reaction they cannot see?<br /><br />No, these reviews bear investigation; if not the criminal sort, then at least the sociological sort, where we reflect upon what we have become as a society.  The Simply Bar, if it does anything positive for us, will remind us that food should have a pleasant taste and texture, and is not simply the aggregation of its ingredient list.

      "My only previous experience with energy drinks was as an observer of someone who used them regularly, and what I saw there didn't make me want to rush in. When I had the chance to try this Red Rain Energy Shot, I thought, why not? but I moved it from shelf to shelf for a while before drinking it down in the middle of a challenging afternoon at work.  The taste was fine though with a bit of an aftertaste; you really don't choose these products for their yummy-ness, do you?<br /><br />That one experience didn't give me a high level of expertise, but I can say that I got through the afternoon, didn't have any bad effects like jitters or crashing, sort of forgot that I'd even taken it, and then decided maybe it was effective and unobtrusive--a good combination. I'd consider using it again, as one of several ways to get an energy boost.  I do question the ingredients, though. I'd want to do some research on what all these ingredients are, and what they do, before relying on this product or any other like it. (And yet....I'd have a cup of coffee or some peanut M&Ms without hesitation for an energy boost: go figure...)<br /><br />Probably not my energy-booster of choice, in other words.

But I am able to cut it up in little chunks and my dogs LOVE it. Which surprised me as they turn their noses up to so much (I have 4 dogs.) Like Iams as an example; my dogs hate the stuff but others swear by it.<br /><br />The light formula is great as it helps maintain and even reduce weight which is very important if you have small dogs, of which I have 3. The other is a boxer and he loves this stuff too. I mix it with dry - well, not mix really, but rather put both wet and dry in the same bowl for each dog so I am able to measure how much they each get. When I took them off this and opted instead for a more affordable regular wet food, the weight came back which is not good, especially for my little chihuahua.<br /><br />Every review should be taken with a grain of salt.

And it had all the texture, shape, and smell of real bread, but something was off about it. It had a sweet taste to it--which I hate in bread. Pamela's is a great company and their products are fantastic, but I don't find this all purpose at all. Evaporated cane sugar, honey, and molasses have no business in something a company claims customers can use for anything from pizza to biscuits.<br /><br />I made the mistake of using this stuff for dredging for fried chicken. I almost threw up--sweet fried chicken? Gross. The dumplings in chicken and dumplings? Sweet enough to be unpalatable. Pizza? My 4 year old wouldn't eat it.<br /><br />But hey--if you're using it in something sweet like waffles or making cookies, it works like a dream. And I will sing it praises for that, but unfortunately, I need something that is truly all purpose and without added sugar.<br /><br />For me, I'd rather mix my own GF mix, it's cheaper and just as fast without the hit and miss issues with this mix. I'll use up the stuff I have for anything that requires sugar, but I've learned my lesson.\n",

Through repetition I have sort of gotten to a point that it is at least tolerable to consume, but I don't look forward to drinking it and will not purchase it again.  Unfortunately many detox teas taste really bad because of the herbs used I guess, but some do taste better - for example the Yogi Tea Peach Detox was what I was using before so I will definately be running back to that. It makes me wonder though - are the better tasting ones less effective?  I guess that's why I gave it two stars and why I am choking my way through it.

      "Unfortunately I got this coffee through the Amazon Vine program and nowhere in the description did it state that this product was for pod-type coffee makers. Also unfortunately, while the box says it holds \"single serve pods\" it does not specify that they're pods for a machine, or in fact what machines they work with.  The packets themselves say nothing at all about pods or machines.<br /><br />So here's the problem: I have a box of single serve coffee pods which don't really tell me much of anything, requested because I thought they were simply single-serve coffee bags, not unlike tea bags.  And I don't own a pod coffee maker.  I don't like them very much.  I'm going to have to improvise in order to do any sort of review.<br /><br />I tossed a couple of pods into my standard drip coffee maker and added two cups of water (The classic 6 oz cup by which coffee is still measured in spite of the fact that we now live in a world where 16 oz cups are considered small.) What I got back out was a brew that would make church coffee laugh derisively. So then I just threw two bags into a cup and added 12 oz of hot water, and let them steep until the brew looked darker, and that actually worked pretty well.  With due respect to the gentleman who said \"teabagging\" with these things doesn't work, I have to disagree.  It makes a decent enough cup.  The coffee isn't strong, but it is smooth, and has has the classic African warmth and brightness.<br /><br />In all fairness, the truest test of this coffee would be to use it in a pod-style coffee maker, but absent that, you can actually make a decent cup without much work.  Just remember that it's 1 pod to each 6 oz of water, no matter what the instructions say.<br /><br />Which brings me to a gripe.  Where the heck are people finding instructions?  There are none on the box, none on the individual packets.  The only instruction I found was on the pod itself.  One side says: \"This side down\"  Seriously, even if your product is for a machine, it's a good idea to be clear about how to use the product in that machine.<br /><br />All in all, Marley Coffee got points for flavor but lost them for unnecessarily vague packaging and the fact that it's kind of pricey.  I don't honestly think that I'd change my review substantially even if I had a pod-style coffee maker to test it with, however if I do manage to find one and it changes my opinion, I will absolutely update this review.<br /><br />Amazon, you need to give a bit more information in your descriptions for Vine reviewers.  At least to the point where you let us know if any special equipment is required to use a product.\n",

It's light, vegetal and very smooth.  To get the full flavor you need to use more leaves than most other green teas, and make sure the water temperature doesn't go over 180 degrees.  I often mix this tea with cascade mint, jasmine green or other Stash loose leaf herbal teas because although it's very good by itself, plain green tea can get boring day-after-day.

I placed my order on the 10th, and it didn't start to ship until the 17th.  It took a week before it even left the facility.

Aside from that fact (that will keep me a customer for life on its own), I also just feel great in general. I take a teaspoon in the morning and a teaspoon in the evening which i dissolve in warm water. It tastes like a bland lemonade, which is fine by me. I'm not here for the flavor, i'm here for the health benefits. My bathroom trips are more regular and my muscles don't feel as sore after I exercise. One thing I would like to note, just in case it happens for anyone else, is that the first 3 days I was getting a pain in my temple randomly throughout the day. Research has led me to believe that this was from the artificial sweetener in the raspberry lemonade flavoring. I'm not having those pains anymore, and when I order again i'll probably stick with the same flavor. I hope this helps someone else may be on the fence about it.\n",

If you need a pure bulk, as fast as you can, I recommend cyto-gainer but we all know whey is tough on the stomach of many people, including myself.<br /><br />There's been a lot of controversy regarding the high protein for muscle gain/weight loss and the jury seems to still be out. However, what I can say for sure (because Doctors and nutritionists have told me) is that more than 1g of protein per body weight is going to cause health issues over the long term. Also, the ideal ratio for carbos/fat/protein varies by body type and desired goal, the best way to learn is through trial and error. Personally, a diet relatively high in fat and protein works well for me, but that's only ideal for the short term.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this product for either people who can't take whey or for those wanting to get lean.

      "Unfortunately I got this coffee through the Amazon Vine program and nowhere in the description did it state that this product was for pod-type coffee makers. Also unfortunately, while the box says it holds \"single serve pods\" it does not specify that they're pods for a machine, or in fact what machines they work with.  The packets themselves say nothing at all about pods or machines.<br /><br />So here's the problem: I have a box of single serve coffee pods which don't really tell me much of anything, requested because I thought they were simply single-serve coffee bags, not unlike tea bags.  And I don't own a pod coffee maker.  I don't like them very much.  I'm going to have to improvise in order to do any sort of review.<br /><br />I tossed a couple of pods into my standard drip coffee maker and added two cups of water (The classic 6 oz cup by which coffee is still measured in spite of the fact that we now live in a world where 16 oz cups are considered small.) What I got back out was a brew that would make church coffee laugh derisively. So then I just threw two bags into a cup and added 12 oz of hot water, and let them steep until the brew looked darker, and that actually worked pretty well.  With due respect to the gentleman who said \"teabagging\" with these things doesn't work, I have to disagree.  It makes a decent enough cup.  The coffee isn't strong, but it is smooth, and has has the classic African warmth and brightness.<br /><br />In all fairness, the truest test of this coffee would be to use it in a pod-style coffee maker, but absent that, you can actually make a decent cup without much work.  Just remember that it's 1 pod to each 6 oz of water, no matter what the instructions say.<br /><br />Which brings me to a gripe.  Where the heck are people finding instructions?  There are none on the box, none on the individual packets.  The only instruction I found was on the pod itself.  One side says: \"This side down\"  Seriously, even if your product is for a machine, it's a good idea to be clear about how to use the product in that machine.<br /><br />All in all, Marley Coffee got points for flavor but lost them for unnecessarily vague packaging and the fact that it's kind of pricey.  I don't honestly think that I'd change my review substantially even if I had a pod-style coffee maker to test it with, however if I do manage to find one and it changes my opinion, I will absolutely update this review.<br /><br />Amazon, you need to give a bit more information in your descriptions for Vine reviewers.  At least to the point where you let us know if any special equipment is required to use a product.\n",

      "My 16 year old german shepherd mix scratched all the fur off her abdomen. We brought her to the vets and nothing worked. Switched to Avoderm Baked Lamb and Brown Rice and she stopped scratching and the fur came back gradually until now she is back to normal. She had cataracts and could hardly see and her eyes gradually cleared and she can see well enough to catch a toy thrown to her. She had arthritic hip displasia and had to stretch for 10-15 minutes in the morning before she could walk. Now she hops right up in the morning and bounces around the house with our two younger dogs (one a year old). We determined by switching around dog foods that the shepherd is allergic to chicken. Just about all other dog foods have chicken meal or something chicken added to them. The ingredients in this dog food are baked lamb (not lamb meal) and the preservative is vitamin e rather than artificial preservatives. This is the only dog food that works well with all our dogs. I have only found one other prepared dog food with as much or more protein per mass. I am not even sure that advertised claim is accurate. Although the price is high, the dogs eat less of this than regular dog food, so it really does not cost as much more as it seems.<br />Amazon has the cheapest price and very fresh product, but I prefer to support local pet stores and purchase it locally when it is available.\n",

      "I haven't drank diet soda for many years and back then it was the nasty aspartame stuff.  Those drinks are an acquired taste but once you're off the corn syrup it's hard to drink a `regular' soda.  Zevia sodas also have a period where you'll have to get accustomed to the taste.  This is the third flavor of Zevia I've had up until the cola flavor I just got my hands on it was my favorite.  I was getting used to the stevia sweetened zing on earlier flavors of orange and black cherry before I got the root beer.  It tasted really good to me when I first started drinking it but it took my wife a bit more time to realize it was good.  She had stayed away from Zevia after tasting the orange which she did not like.  Zevia sodas still have a little aftertaste (the zing I refereed to above) that kind of sits with you for a few seconds but the longer you drink it the more used to it you get.<br /><br />However, there are two major problems with ordering Zevia products.  First, they're expensive.  At just over a dollar a can they are pricey, no other way to describe it.  The second, is availability.  Amazon is really having some issues with keeping Zevia flavors in stock with Prime shipping.  The third party sellers all have exuberant shipping prices bringing your case of soda to over fifty dollars.  I've emailed Zevia about this and did get a response from them.  I hope Amazon can keep it stocked and Zevia can keep them supplied.  It's a good product but it's been frustrating trying to order due to Amazon's stock.  Due to the high price tag I put it on a monthly schedule to save 15%.  It helps but I wonder if Amazon will have it ready to go each month.<br /><br />The Zevia Root Beer is a very good tasting soda.  I'll definitely continue to drink it if I can afford to and Amazon has it available.\n",

Contrary to some reviews, I don't find it to be weak at all and in fact, is quite bold but with absolutely not hints of being bitter.  Very smooth and leaves a great aftertaste.

I mean who doesn't associate peanuts and Planters?<br /><br />Overall, Planters Creamy peanut butter is very creamy and I was very impressed at how easily it spreads onto bread. There was no clumping or oil separation and this tastes great on sandwiches or as a spoonful right out of the jar. It's not as sweet as other peanut butters, which many may prefer.<br /><br />I do have to agree with another reviewer who was disappointed that the oil used was hydrogenated soybean oil. This means the oil was treated with hydrogen gas to increase shelf life and change texture, which also elevates your \"bad\" cholesterol and lowers your \"good\" cholesterol.

      "Our older cat is having some health issues, which I \"suspect\" could have been caused by pet foods many of us buy in local stores. We've been on a mission to find a healthy pet food we could trust after all the pet food recalls. After going through way too many products trying to find one that did all it claimed to do, we found the PetGuard line of food. This one really does appear to be all it claims to be and our cats are thriving on it! Our older cat loves it and is acting more like a kitten than he's acted in years. Both of our cats fur is silky and smooth and they seem to have endless energy, not to mention they love this stuff! Our youngest cat has digestion problems and most cat foods give him horrible gas.. But not this cat food! He isn't having any digestion problems at all..<br />Both our cats love the \"fish,chicken & liver\" dinner but our older cat isn't crazy about the \"seafood savory dinner\". He'll eat it but much prefers the fish,chicken and liver.<br />From my point of view, the fish, chicken and liver dinner doesn't smell too bad, but the seafood savor dinner smells really bad!<br />One problem I have with the food I've purchased from Amazon is that every single can in the case has been dented. I've purchased 2 cases and it's been the same with both cases.. I've purchased this from other vendors and never received a dented can, so this seems to be an Amazon problem.. Not sure why, but some of the cans are really hard to open!<br />I'm relieved to finally find a food I'm not afraid to feed my pets.. I've read articles about this food that state the meat used in it is a grade that can be consumed by humans. That makes me feel much better about what my cats are eating.<br />UPDATE:<br />It's been about a year since we started using this and our older cat is doing very well on it. Amazon was out of stock once when I needed to reorder, so I purchased another organic brand. Not only did our older cat turn up his nose to the other brand, but so did our 2 other cats. They would not eat the other kind, so when Pet Guard was back in stock, I ordered another case and the cats were happy kitties! They all love this stuff.. I think it stinks, but apparently, that's part of the attraction for them.\n",

      "I only got one of these to try so I didn't get to do much experimenting, but here is what I have to say after eating one of them<br /><br />1) yes, the entire thing was completely cooked to a good temperature after 60 seconds.<br /><br />2) this does not have to be refrigerated, making it an excellent choice to keep in a drawer at work or to take with you to school, not sure how well it will sit in a hot car, but seems like a good choice for that meal you wish you had the time or money for but just can't squeeze into the day<br /><br />3) Fairly healthy choice, whole grain pasta that actually tastes pretty good, and a tomato sauce rather than a dairy based which makes it a better choice<br /><br />4) portion size - I added this as a side to a breaded baked Italian chicken dinner.  It added a nice flavor and served the two of us well as the side.  If this were to be my entire meal I imagine this would feed one, as a side dish it feeds two.<br /><br />5) I don't know what the real price is for these, I would consider them to be valued at two to three dollars each.<br /><br />6) As far as the overall flavor, I found the sauce to be a little sweet for my taste, but for the convenience I could put up with the overly sweet sauce.<br /><br />I think that if the price is right, these are an excellent choice for healthy eating at the office, or at school or any other time that you are lacking on time and options.  I would buy these if they were to come available at the local grocer for a reasonable price.\n",

Those also come with lots of liquid/oil etc in the can which happens to be BPA-free. These are dry and pasty and have very little fluid in the can. Also, I followed the link here from the Crown Prince website which advertises these as being packed in BPA-free cans. However, when they arrived I realized they weren't. I contacted Crown Prince about this and they basically said that amazon is selling an older stock in BPA-coated cans. I'm annoyed that they'd place a link on their site to \"order now from amazon\" and then when you order it is not the product advertised on their website.

      "First impressions of this coffee was not positive as the box contains no instructions what-so-ever as to what kind of coffee-maker is required for these pods. Additionally there is no mention of how much water to use with each pod, or whether it is a single or four cup serving.<br /><br />HOWEVER... Once that was settled (It is recommended between 6oz and 8oz of water per pod and it can be used in any traditional drip coffee machine, or used in the same fashion as a tea bag)... I was ultimately surprised and delighted at how dark and rich the resulting coffee looked. I brewed it at full strength the first time, to see what its got. I don't normally like my coffee super strong, but I was overwhelmed with the delicious aroma of this product. The first waft was clearly rich and nutty, although the packaging says exotic floral and berry. The taste was beyond anything I could hope for. I was shocked at how much flavor this coffee contained since it is also very smooth without being bitter. The second time I brewed this coffee, using the tea bag method and hot water, I actually let it soak until I was finished dressing for work, so around 15 minutes or so. Keep in mind I do not usually care for coffee that is overpoweringly strong, but the addition time only created a more intense flavor and aroma which, after only two experiences with it, I found myself craving a repeat experience. I added a little Splenda and plain creamer to it and rather than masking the flavor, the coffee-nutty-berry flavor came through with perfection.<br /><br />All in all I would say this coffee has performed better than any other brand of coffee I have had my hands on in the last year or two... which is saying something since I am considered fairly obsessed with quality coffee. The price is around sixty-three cents per cup and is MORE than worth it!!\n",

      "I'm a peanut butter fan, I also like chocolate and have eaten the occasional granola bar at times. So, I jumped at a chance to give these bars a try.<br /><br />The very first thing I noticed is, there are only 5 bars in a box. A curious number. I mean, they could have certainly fit a 6th one into the box. Second thing I noticed is these bars are small. I know they're not intended as a meal, or anything, but honestly 4 bites and it's gone type of small.<br /><br />Third thing, I couldn't taste the peanut butter and there was only a hint of chocolate for me. Just overall bland. Not gross type bland, just very little flavor.<br /><br />Based on Amazon's way of shipping groceries you purchase a 6 pack of boxes. 5 bars per box, equals 30 bars. I'm not sure the price, size, and taste would have me paying that much for the end value.<br /><br />They are alright, but there are so many other options out there already for bars of this type.

      "14 out of 24 cans arrived dented, due to inadequate packaging (boxes were shrink wrapped to a cardboard tray and then thrown in a shipping box with a small amount of butcher paper).  Dense material like canned goods should be surrounded with packing peanuts in order to arrive undamaged.  Needless to say, I will not order canned goods again through Amazon.<br /><br />This is not the end of the story.  Amazon's standard policy on damaged food is 10%, or 20% maximum discount.  In this case, 58.3% of the food  arrived damaged--and no way was I going to pay for what I won't use.  After 1/2 hour on the phone, the customer service manager granted me an \"exception\" and allowed a refund of 58.3% of my purchase price.  But I should not have had to waste so much of my time insisting on it.<br /><br />That said, Harmony Farms dog food itself is a great product.  The reason I'm willing to pay almost $2 per can is that it's made in the USA (no danger of melamine, etc.).  So there you have it.  Good product, but you'll probably be happier if you find a place to buy it locally.\n",

      "With the large number of choices in the chocolate market, it can take a lot to impress but ScharffenBerger Milk Chocolate manages to do just that.  Not knowing what to expect, I thought this might be the smaller squares common with higher end confections but this was a rather \"king size\" chocolate bar.  So the questions as to what one might get in quantity for the price is answered for the positive.<br /><br />Then we get to the taste and this is as good as anything one can find with prepackaged chocolate.  The texture is rich and creamy and the taste sweet without being overbearingly so.  There are hints of caramel in the flavor but more in the background and integrated into the chocolate rather than as filling.  It achieves an exquisite balance and manages to produce one of the upper echelon milk chocolate bars on the market.  Those who like their chocolate more on the heavier and/or bitter side might not be as impressed but then they would probably avoid the milk chocolate genre entirely.  If their achievement here is any indication, they likely would have other high quality products to satisfy such preferences.<br /><br />Schaffen-Berger Milk Chocolate is not a bar to be eaten quickly but one to be savored slowly.  This is my first experience with this company and I have come away highly impressed.\n",

Even our local Vitamin Shoppe does not carry this size in their store.<br /><br />I used this mainly because of my flaky, dry skin....right after taking a shower when your pores are still open is the best time to apply this all over...even your face. I live in Chicago and during the cold season- nothing really works for my skin but this product.<br /><br />I am familiar with coconut oil since i was born and grew up in the Philippines where this product may have originated.  We used it for everything including cooking.<br /><br />I also use this in my hair after i take a shower. makes my hair feels silky.  I also used this for back massage and to relieve muscle pain....<br /><br />It's really great to have coconut oil in your house because of its plenty of uses!!! The price here at Amazon is unbelievable!!! and with free shipping as well....Highly Recommended!!!<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />Well i finally trash my body lotions and use this instead as body lotion.

I have a 15 lb cairn terrier and give him 1/4 can each day (dinner) so the case lasts me a good long time.  I also give him a fish oil pill with it.  So far so good.

First off, I'm used to buying the regular sized frosted mini-wheats, so these small ones are kind of amusing.  It's like a mini mini-wheat!  I don't find that the size makes them any easier to eat; if nothing else, it makes them go soggy a bit faster.  As for the taste, the box says \"cinnamon roll\" and indeed it does taste strongly of cinnamon, and oddly, maple syrup.  It's not an unpleasant taste, but it maybe should've been called \"cinnamon toast\" flavor instead.  I would prefer it to be sweeter, but I've got quite the sweet tooth!  I'm sure people who prefer a more mellow cereal would enjoy this one a lot more than I did.  Also, 47 of the little squares is apparently the recommended serving size.  What a joke!

One of the main reasons to drink kombucha is to bring beneficial bacteria into the gut to balance gut flora to aid digestion, nutrient absorption and to fight off bad bacteria and other invaders.  Pasteurization kills this bacteria rendering them useless.  There are still plenty of B vitamins in the drink that the body may still utilize even after pasteurization.  If you are buying it for taste and the small amount of B vitamins, go for it.  If you are buying it to nourish your body and introduce probiotics into your system, forget this product.

I don't know if this would be a great thing to drink just to relieve stress, like during the day, because of the melatonin in it. I found this in a local natural food store and only bought one can..now I'm wishing I bought the whole shelf! I will definitely drink this nightly once I get more. If you're looking to unwind at the end of a long day, without drugs, alcohol or harsh chemicals then this is definitely for you. I was skeptical at first because at $1.75 a can, (& I didn't even know if it would be worth it), to me, that's money I could be using toward gas, lol! Anyway, it was worth it and I can't wait to get more!\n",

      "UPDATE (10/9/12):<br /><br />I asked the company on Facebook about how much magnesium and potassium are in each can, since it is not listed even though the can advertises having lots of both (?). Their reply was \"about 676 mg Potassium and 29.12 mg Magnesium.\"<br /><br />---<br /><br />It seems that coconut water is one of those love-or-hate flavors that exist in the world (kind of like avocado).  There doesn't seem to be a middle ground, either you really dislike it, or really like it.<br /><br />I'm definitely in the really-like camp. And I had to get to this brand to discover that. I had tried both <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LL0R8I\">Vita Coco 100% Pure Coconut Water, 11.1-Ounce Containers (Pack of 12)</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UUWECC\">O.N.E. Coconut Water, 11.2-Ounce Aseptic Containers (Pack of 12)</a>, and found both of them insipid tasting.  But I find this brand refreshing and full of body.<br /><br />I compare the difference between \"good\" and \"bad\" coconut water to the difference between apple juice from concentrate and not from concentrate.  The former has a watery taste, like it's not the real thing, whereas the latter is more like drinking an apple.<br /><br />This brand seems more like drinking a coconut (although that's something I've never done). But it doesn't have the icky blandness to it that the above brands have.<br /><br />I also really enjoy the bits of coconut pulp, they had to the experience and taste.<br /><br />This makes a great base for powder mixes, especially flavored ones like <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003SG4NDI\">Vega Whole Food Shake & Go Smoothie - Tropical Tango - 300g - Powder</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003SFTJD8\">Sequel Naturals Vega Shake and Go Smoothie Bodacious Berry -- 10.6 oz</a>, and even <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HI1LSI\">Garden of Life Perfect Food Raw Organic Powder Nutritional Supplement, 240 Grams</a>.<br /><br />It's also great to drink as-is, straight from the can, as both a pre- and post-hydrator.  I often drink half the can before a work-out and the other half after I'm done. If you research, it is best to pre-hydrate so your body has the extra fluids/minerals readily available as they are being depleted, rather than only hydrating after you are exhausted and dehydrated.<br /><br />This 12-pack will last you a long time, especially considering each can is two servings (~2 cups).\n",

Strong ginger flavor tempered by mild peanut butter.<br />Original: Unadulterated sweet ginger flavor.

Others like these, but not me.<br />Peppermint: Ye gods, this tastes like mouthwash.  It's not well balanced and tastes more like medicine than candy.<br /><br />If you're curious about all the flavors, get this once.  Otherwise, pick your favorite flavors and stick with those.\n",

I'd never heard of such a thing. What a good idea!  (The dinner, on the whole, has two grams fewer of carbohydrates, at 47g carbohydrate, 7g sugar. I was hoping that this would be a good alternative for a diabetic friend, but it won't be.)<br /><br />My only deviation from the recipe on the box was using 1% milk.  I didn't doctor it with extra ingredients or by adding vegetables, because I wanted to taste what it tasted like on its own.<br /><br />It tasted like Kraft Macaroni and Cheese, the stuff that my mom occasionally fed us when we were kids.  The pasta was soft but not mushy. The cheese concoction tastes the same as the standard.<br /><br />Not as good as my friend Meem's homemade - it's not even the same category - but DEFINITELY better than adequate as a comfort food from one's childhood.<br /><br />The other member of my household agreed on all points, including, since \"sneaking\" vegetables in our household was never an issue, that this would taste even yummier with fresh broccoli or cauliflower in it.<br /><br />More Kraft Macaroni and Cheese, please?\n",

      "The Switch Black Cherry soda has a light, fruity taste and less fizz than a regular soft drink. It's a pretty color -- sort of  a deep maroon.  It would make a nice addition to a fruit punch which you might mix for a party.  I put the can into the refrigerator overnight and then poured it into a glass with no ice.<br /><br /> I enjoyed it very much, although I must say that the black cherry flavor is not really dominant.  It tastes fruity, and it has no chemical taste like some fruit-flavored soft drinks.  Overall, I think it tastes better than  Juicy Juice, which it kind of reminded me of.  Actually, \"black cherry juice\" is the third ingredient listed -- apple and grape juices are listed first.<br /><br />I like the can size (which is less beverage than a regular 12-ounce soda) because I constantly find myself opening a Coke and then not finishing (and thus wasting) the remaining soda.  So this 8.3 ounce size is perfect for my taste.<br /><br />Switch soda is advertised as being more healthful because it has no added sugar, but that's not quite the case if you read the product's ingredient list.  The juice used has sugar, it's just not artificially sugared, and it has no artificial colors.  So it's all juice, but those juices have sugar.  It's more healthful than a regular soda, though, since it's all-natural.<br /><br />Switch is a little pricy.  I buy it for a special treat for myself or my daughters since it is something different from the regular soft drinks, and it has doesn't contain artificial ingredients.  We also like the Tangerine/Orange flavor, but are not crazy about the Grape.\n",

I think the SPAM brand has better flavor and texture, but the Walmart brand has zero reported carbs per serving where SPAM is one, probably from the added sugar.  This may be of interest for one on a low-carb diet.  After frying (or cauterizing as some say), they all give nice tasty semi-crispy patties.<br /><br />Other thoughts: Even though I got SPAM Bacon on a good deal here, the \"best by\" date is thirty-six months away, so I did not get old stock.\n",

      "This is the second (and last) time in a few years that I buy Pim's Orange from Amazon. Like the first time, I was disappointed, not because of the cookie itself, which is normally delicious--as a French person, I am very familiar with PIM'S cookies and know what they should taste and look like--, but because of the improper manner in which the packages are stored and handled along the way (I cannot figure out at which end). Obviously, the packages go from cold to hot temperatures (or vice versa), possibly multiple times, which is the worst thing that can happen to cookies incorporating chocolate and filling: this alters their appearance and consistency--chocolate surface becomes discolored and collapses due to melting before regaining some firmness, and the cookie part and filling become too soft. The taste is not affected too badly, but you cannot serve them to guests, because of the cookies' miserable appearence.  In order to save them anyway for my own consumption, I wrap the individual packs in a bath towel and store them in the vegetable compartment of my refrigerator. That helps regain some firmness in the cookies, but of course the chocolate surface remains discolored. So my advice is:  buy individual packs at your grocery store if they carry PIM'S, because the cookies are normally delicious, but do not buy them from Amazon.  It's too bad that Amazon has done nothing so far to correct this storage problem. I buy a lot of stuff from Amazon, to my satisfaction 99 p.100 of the time, including LU \"Petit Beurre\" cookies (these are rarely available in US grocery stores). Since they include no chocolate or filling, the shipments are usually in perfect condition.  I give PIM,S Orange three stars because the product is excellent under normal conditions, and the problem is not caused by the manufacturer.\n",

      "<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TNXSZG\">Guayaki Traditional Loose Yerba Mate</a> is a personal favorite, as is Peet's Coffee and Tea Masala Chai. Both of them have their own unique qualities that are great in a cup of tea, Guayaki's Mate in it's own unique taste, and Peet's Masala Chai in its pungent and fragrant mix of spices and black tea.<br /><br />So, naturally, I thought that I'd like Chai Mate. Wow... was I in for a surprise. The resulting mixture was a disappointingly weak blend of Mate and other ingredients. Now, I believe a great cup of Chai to be one that you can smell from thirty feet away - and you absolutely will get that with a good correctly brewed cup of Peet's. Pour some cream into it, and the dark color of the tea blends with the cream into a delicious looking cup of tea. Or even enjoy it plain. Or just with sugar. And the same with Loose Yerba Mate, you know the taste, you want a strong cup of tea, and you want it's flavor.<br /><br />With Chai Mate, you get a weak tasting Mate taste and a insipid tasting Chai taste that overall smells way too healthy for Chai and way too weak for Mate. Overall these two don't mix - neither, incidentally, does cream... pour some of that into the tea and it will look watery, thin, and not very inviting.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, buy the Traditional Loose Yerba Mate and then buy a tin of Peet's Masala Chai and have two cups of GREAT tasting tea, not one cup of bland, insipid, and watery tea.\n",

The 8.4 ounce can size is perfect for a quick thirst-quencher.  While the calorie count is comparable to other regular sodas, it's a bit lower and consists of natural sugars from juices... not high fructose corn syrup. (What is that stuff anyway?) And, it's fizzy.  I like the fizz.<br /><br />Now for the bad: it barely tastes like pomegranate.  I realize that most folks would be turned off by an overly-tart, full force pom flavor; but the can promises pomegranate.  Yet reading the ingredients, pomegranate is listed fifth in the juice list. Fifth.  Behind apple, grape, pineapple, and lemon.  Oddly enough, the sixth juice: cranberry, seems to steal the show as that's the flavor I was able to notice other than the over-powering grape.<br />And that makes me sad.  Izze's other flavors (like grapefruit and clementine) really showcase the fruit on the label.  Just not here.<br /><br />If you'd rather have a sweet drink than a real pom experience, give this a shot. But if you're looking for some honest pomegranate flavor, look elsewhere.\n",

The normal metalic or plastic taste of bottled water is not present here (at least I couldn't perceive it) and the water is so smooth! This is stating the obvious, but it tastes better cool or cold and when it's at that temperature, I could not detect any aftertaste. I would buy Essentia at my local convenience store if they carried it!\n",

      "I must admit these do work for getting your pets to take pills - 2 very finicky dogs who almost always spit out their pills in any food did scarf their pills down when put in these.  However, after only 2 pills (separated by 8 hours), one of my dogs (8 month old puppy) became violently ill about 2 hours after the 2nd pill pocket with numerous episodes of explosive diarrhea and vomiting (ultimately very bloody after 12 hours).  It ended up costing us money for a vet visit and medicine to get the dog to get well, and a major scare that the puppy was going to die (could hardly move after 18 hrs of this).  The medicine was not new, nor any thing else changed, so I presume it was due to these (certainly not going to try them again to see).  Our other dog (full adult) did fine, however.  Maybe it should just not be used for puppies, or maybe it's just an unusual reaction, but if you google \"pill pockets diarrhea\", you will see this is an occasional known side effect.<br />Would suggest trying just one of these each of the first few days to make sure your pet is not intolerant of these. 1 out of 2 for me was not good odds.\n",

Second, I, like many people, am fructose intolerant.  Some studies show that fructose intolerance is just as common as lactose intolerance.  I can handle a normal amount of natural fructose, but the additional fructose in processed foods leads to digestive problems.<br /><br />Is it really worth tarnishing the reputation of this classic product by using HFCS?  How much does this actually save per bottle?  I bet less than a penny.  If they are willing to cut corners on this ingredient, how can the rest of the ingredients be trusted?<br /><br />Because of Lea & Perrins cost cutting, I have switched to French's Worcestershire Sauce.  They use molasses and regular corn syrup, not HFCS.\n",

      "A long time ago, Burger King had this little promotion going on that had a little packet of cheese powder that came glued to a paper bag with your order so you could dump your fries in, add the powder, and shake the bag up and coat the fries in cheesy decadence.<br /><br />I've been trying to find the equivilent of these packets on the market. This wasn't it. Not only was this NOT it, this isn't a very user friendly product, and it's uses are very linear.<br /><br />>The powder will NOT work in any sort of shaker, unlike the cheese powders you see for popcorn. This makes dispensing the powder a little annoying because it pretty much as to stay in the bag.<br /><br />>While it does taste like cheese when you dap a bit on your finger, the flavor ends there when added to any foods (in a moderate amount)<br /><br />>Tossing it with anything wet/fried with result in large clumps of cheese gathering at the bottom with less than 5% of what you used actually sticking to your food.<br /><br />>Adding it to soups for flavor proved to be just as problematic because the powder mimics the old \"Ovaltine\" habit of clumping up in little bubbles of itself and won't mix in.<br /><br />Basically, this product has only one real intended use it seems: if you want to make your own macaroni and cheese that tastes just like Kraft, here's the powder in bulk form. Still need butter and milk.<br /><br />So I suppose if you are REALLY pinching pennies, this is a cheaper alternative to an already cheap meal. But there is no diversity whatsoever and to me, that's disappointing enough to keep me from ever ordering more.\n",

      "Say that 10 times real fast.<br /><br />These sheets are like a sheet of paper. I immediately opened them and tried 1 sheet as is. It is very sharp like paper. It almost feels as if you could get a paper cut from them so be careful if eating them raw.<br /><br />I have never tried any other brands, but I own a few other Navita products and I have been satisfied with their quality.<br /><br />These sheets are very good tasting in my opinion.<br /><br />They have a similar taste to the green Mactha <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003O7T87C\">DoMatcha DoMatcha Organic 2nd Harvest Matcha, 2.82-Ounce</a>, but with a much saltier taste in addition.<br /><br />I cant wait to try these sheet in a soup and a wrap. But they are even good just eating raw as I mentioned before.<br /><br />I recommend this brand for their taste, quality, and price compared to other organic brands of nori out there.<br /><br />****UPDATED 3/14/12<br /><br />I tried the Nori sheets in soup and they were amazing! They add a nice flavoring to the soup and even a overall salty taste, leaving you to add less salt to your soup.<br /><br />Also, I made some sushi using there. They were a bit hard to wrap because of their texture. They do come with perforated lines to show you were to make your cuts for sushi, but it didn't help. Unless you have a super sharp, samurai type knife (pun intended), then these sheets will be hard to cut through. That may well be the case with any seaweed sheet, but I would not know because this was the first time I made sushi.<br /><br />One other thing I could mention is these sheets are pretty big if you are making sushi wraps, especially if you place to roll the seaweed with the rice on the OUTSIDE of the roll. You could definitely get away with using a half a sheet. If you are rolling the rice on the INSIDE like I did, then you might have to use the whole sheet, but they will still be too big and you will waste a bit unless you cut it off and use the extra in a soup later.<br /><br />Even still, the sushi turned out amazing (even though I wasted quite a bit because of the cutting issue).<br /><br />I still recommend these sheets and will be buying more.\n",

Nope.  Tasted awful and I ended up embarrassingly giving one box to the needy Food Bin and gave the other opened box to some people at work.

      "This is THE best hot seasoning out there.  It's super hot and at first all you may get out of it is hot, but if you're in it for pure heat then go with the 3am special reserve from blair (basically pure, slightly diluted capsaicin). However, this powder has a great flavor of its own as well as acting like MSG by exciting all the other flavors in your food - so power through the first few applications, let your system get used to it, then everything tastes way better because of it.  I use it on everything except sweets.  People will be insulted when you want to sprinkle on their homemade dish because they don't understand that it's not like normal hotsauce; just tell them that it's exactly like their salt and pepper but more-so.<br /><br />The best part is no matter how much hot you are used to, you can achieve a superior sharp burn without the acid reflux side-effects of super-hotsauce (pure capsaicin actually counteracts acid reflux and ulcer problems fyi) or the intestinal problems associated with non-extracted habanero or ghost chili powder.  Or you can just get some heat and flavor - whatever you're in the mood for, Nitro will abide.  Additionally, it's much harder to get hot-eyes with Nitro than with super-hotsauces because it's a powder and doesn't stay on your hands.<br /><br />non-chiliheads: I suggest you go with Blair's Death Rain Habanero - great flavor without as much heat (still hot though, it's about 1/4th as hot as Nitro by weight).<br /><br />caution: do not fry\n",

Regrettably, a short time ago, they discontinued carrying the item, and I can't find the fingerlings at any other nearby store.<br /><br />So, I checked Amazon.com and found Melissa's fingerling potatoes. They arrived in good order, with no delay. There are several varieties and colors of potatoes here, all small. One dish that we use them for is a quinoa potato dish. Boil quinoa and potatoes for a bit. Then put them in the oven in a roasting pan and cover with shredded cheddar cheese, roast for a bit, and then eat the dish. Believe it or not, a tasty quinoa dish!<br /><br />The potatoes, of course, can be eaten any other way one would wish. The one issue that I had was that the black potatoes had little sprouts beginning to emerge (not a great thing), but it was not a real problem.<br /><br />I am a satisfied customer and as long as the local grocery stores don't stock the mixed fingerlings, I'll continue to purchase Melissa's.\n",

I like my coffee bold, and strong, so trying to drink normal coffee (especially of the instant variety) is like giving a whiskey junkie a glass of Kahlua and milk.  So with that in mind, take note that my definition of \"weak\" may be very different from yours.  Anyway, let me start with my review.  Taster's Choice is meant to be made in 6oz portions.  I filled my standard sized 12oz (The Who!) coffee mug around 3/4 to the brim, so I may have over filled it a bit. (READ UPDATE BELOW)  That being said, Taster's Choice would only provide you a half-full mug of coffee if you followed their instructions properly.  The coffee tasted similar to what you would find at a cheap gas station.  It can only be described as similar to Crystal Light packets, in that your water doesn't exactly taste like Gatorade, but it surely doesn't taste like water either.  I tried adding a few tablespoons of flavored coffee creamer to see if it improved the taste, and it did in a big way.  The flavor was then similar to what you would receive out of those automated \"cappuccino machines\" that you would find in gas stations and breakrooms. (You know, the ones that tell you to only fill up the cup 3/4 of the way because the machine keeps flowing coffee even after you let go of the button?)  If you have ever tasted the \"cappuccino\" out of those machines, you'd know that it isn't anything like cappuccino, but it doesn't taste horrible.  It's drinkable, and has a sweet kick to it.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />I'm sure that using two packets would improve the flavor of a 3/4 full mug greatly, so I'm probably going to try that next time around and update my review. (READ UPDATE BELOW) I'm sure that some people would find this useful as a \"fast food coffee\".  It's not great, but it's not bad either, and it provides a little jolt for someone who doesn't have the time to brew a whole pot.<br /><br />*UPDATE*:  I have now tried it with two packets in 8 ounces of water, and it is MUCH better.  It now tastes like quite a bold flavorful coffee.  Highly recommend that you use two packets for each cup.\n",

I cut them up for stir frys and soups, and I slice them for sandwiches. They're good instead of chicken in a sandwich, but they are small and can fall out. How about a tortilla with avocado spread on it and some lettuce, wrapped around some Tender Bits, whole or sliced? Add pepper and/or onion! Although I am a strict vegetarian, I have a sensitive digestive system, and I turn to Tender Bits when my system is irritated. I have been eating these by the case for years and am glad to find them on Amazon!<br /><br />Update: After being diagnosed with a small breast cancer, I learned that soy protein concentrate, a main ingredient in Tender Bits, is a controversial ingredient. To put it simply, foods with this ingredient are \"processed food\" and should be eaten in the amounts one would eat any processed meat or other food. Vegetarians should be careful about eating too much processed vegetarian foods. Soy has an important relationship to estrogen, which means that vegetarian women and especially those who have had estrogen-positive breast cancer should learn more about it.<br /><br />I have not had any Tender Bits in many months, but I keep a can on hand for special occasions!\n",

      "The first sip gave a pleasing kiwi flavor burst with a light tang of carbonation.  When testing the black cherry flavor, I had placed the can in the freezer for a short period, since I prefer drinks to be ice cold or hot; I didn't want lukewarm to get in the way of a positive response to the first sip.  As the drink warmed a bit, the sweetness overtook the carbonation, which is inevitable in a carbonated beverage, yet, due to the purity of the fruit base, the flavor remained true and welcome.<br /><br />This time, I just had the drink chilled perfectly for me, no ice crystals.  I like the kiwi even better than the cherry!  The kiwi has more tang.  See below (or on the product description on the buying page) for the juice blends used.  I've noticed that most juices currently have apple and grape included, likely because those are cheaper to produce.<br /><br />The way the drink was promoted wasn't a lie!  It worked for me:<br /><br />1. \"100 % of what you want.  0% of what you don't want.\"<br /><br />2. \"Make The Switch to a great tasting, all natural beverage that's the perfect balance between JUICE and CARBONATION.\"<br /><br />3. The logo has \"THE\" placed upside-down and reversed, atop \"Switch,\" with a swirl designed around the words, the swirl imitating the symbol for reversing something.<br /><br />4. The ingredients read: \"100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, kiwi, acerola* [I added the asterisk; see below] and raspberry and strawberry juice concentrated), natural flavors, ascorbic acid (vitamin C)\"<br /><br />5. 100% juice carbonated.<br /><br />6. The can is smaller than the norm for soda pops, which I also liked, because when I used to drink sodas regularly, I usually opened a can and left half of it to get too warm (and fizzed out), so the remainder went down the drain (after I returned it to the fridge for a few days hoping I might drink it).  I drank the whole can of Black Cherry!<br /><br />I decided I liked the near slush state of a short stint in the freezer... leaving it too long, though, might cause too much separation of the fruit concentrate from the fizz water... and, of course, makes it undrinkable from the can until it melts enough to flow through the hole in the top.<br /><br />In the past, when I had begun wanting something more natural than most soda beverages (with phosphates, etc., added), I had used frozen orange juice concentrate added to Club Soda or Ginger ale.  It didn't take long to feel that the process was too much trouble (and it was more expensive than the cost of the Switch product).  Also, I like the types of fruits Switch is using.<br /><br />At first I was confused at the acerola* ingredient, not knowing what it was.  Since my <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00154JDAI\">Kindle 2: Amazon's New Wireless Reading Device (Latest Generation)</a> was at hand, as always, I looked up acerola in the onboard dictionary.  The word wasn't in there, so I pushed the curser to the right, on the arrow for more types of searches, and used my standby, Google, and found several listings of acerola.<br /><br />Briefly, I found that it's thought to have originated from the Yucatan, and is known as Barbados cherry or wild crape myrtle, a tropical fruit-bearing shrub.  Reading into the variety of praiseworthy qualities of that cherry, I was impressed!  It has 32 times the amount of vitamin C as Orange juice, and many other healthful assets.  If you're interested in details, feel free to go Google.<br /><br />I'm beginning to think that many of the flavors available from Switch will include equally intriguing tropical fruits.  (I was glad to see that the Kiwi flavor also has acerola in it).<br /><br />Though the can is appealing and fine, this beverage is good enough to deserve a designer bottle to appeal to the gourmet crowd who want flavor without true health issues... don't get me started on the myriad of heavy promotions of pseudo health issues.  I have a book in progress to be published on KINDLE, which will debut with steam hissing out of Kindle's ears, at no extra charge!  (I'll add a comment to this review about why I had quit drinking soda pops, which will explain why I will be happily able to welcome Switch into my diet.)<br /><br />My thanks to THE SWITCH for providing a healthy, gourmet quality drink... WITHOUT, thank God, SOYBEANS added!!<br /><br />I'm hooked!<br /><br />Linda Shelnutt<br />Author of several Kindle books and Amazon Shorts\n",

      "I specifically ordered these chips because the nutrition information states they have 4 grams of fiber per serving. They taste good, so I ordered the case from Amazon. (In fact, I even signed up for subscribe and save) When my package arrived today, the bag says they only have 1 gram of fiber per serving! I called Garden of Eatin' and was told that there was new analysis and testing done which shows they only actually have one gram of fiber per serving. That's a huge difference! The customer service rep said the testing was done in September, yet the nutrition information on their own website still shows 4 grams of fiber. To me, that is false advertising. How hard is it to go in change that information on your own website!<br /><br />So, bottom line, if you don't care about the amount of fiber...these are really tasty chips. But if the amount of fiber is what attracted you to them, don't buy!\n",

      "My vet recommended these treats several years ago as a healthier alternative to the treats sold in supermarkets (like the treats shaped like fake bacon, sausages, steaks, etc). My dog LOVES these treats, probably more than she ever like the fake bacon variety of treat. She's not usually bribable, but these seem to do the trick. The only drawback to these treats from my point of view is that they're only available at the vet's office, so I'm thrilled to find them here online.<br /><br />Just a note about one of the other reviews I read: I purchased 4 packages of these at a time at roughly $1.30 per package, and the shipping was still only $5 for all 4 packs. So, even with shipping, the per-unit cost is around $2.50 (which is better than the $5 I was paying at the vet). And I don't think the package is misleading- I've only found these treats in 1 size, and they all have the same picture of a dalmation on the front.<br /><br />Finally, people have mentioned that these could be used to give pills. I think they're probably a little small for hiding pills (unless you're trying to give a 1/2 or 1/4 tab of a VERY small pill). If hiding pills is what you're going for, you'd be better off getting pill pockets (small, cup-shaped treats that you can mold around a pill or capsule).\n",

Fresh blueberries are better, but these are very good.  I saw a few reviews that mentioned everything arriving as powder, but mine arrived in good shape.<br /><br />One thing I really like is that the only ingredient is blueberries.  There's no sulfur (which I'm allergic to) or corn syrup.

The strength of the coffee flavor seemed to diminish the longer it is in your mouth, but that may be a taste bud thing and not a decrease in actual coffee flavor. The same is true with the United Coffee Candy. 8 out of 10<br />  FYI- United, Kopiko and Coffee Rio were the top finishing coffee candies in my taste test.<br />  God bless. Mike\n",

We use the small soft plain bagels cut in two upon which we smooth a bit of cream cheese then a nice ring of caviar in the center of which is colorful and delicious cut up hard cooked egg then add a perfect cup of coffee.

      "StarKist Tuna Chunk Light Pouch In Water, 2.6oz pouches are a very convenient method of eating on the run or preparing a quick meal when time is short. I recently began using Tuna in the pouch and really like how easy it is compared to canned Tuna which requires a can opener and is full of water. The pouch is very easy to open just by tearing the top of the pouch which has a pre-made notch to initiate an easy opening. Once the pouch is open it is not resealable. The Tuna can be eaten directly out of the pouch or you can empty the contents to make a salad or other meal. I now keep some of these Tuna pouches at work and I carry a few in my every day carry (EDC) bag in case I get stuck somewhere and need a quick, easy, and healthy snack to keep me going. I also carry some when hiking, backpacking, or camping.<br /><br />The pouch is relatively strong and would not easily be punctured by an object. As a precaution I do wrap the pouch in a one gallon freezer bag when carrying the Tuna in my EDC bag just as an added measure of caution. Each pouch is considered one portion and contains 80 calories with only 5 calories from fat. Each serving contains 18 grams of protein. The pouch has a label stating that the product may contain bones but I have yet to encounter any bones. This Tuna is a good source of protein and Omega-3 fatty acids. The Tuna is labeled as a product of Thailand and the expiration date is over 2½ years from that date that I purchased the Tuna so it will last awhile and there is no need to be concerned about the expiration date. I have seen this product on sale at a local grocery store for about a dollar which is a great deal.<br /><br />Overall, I am very satisfied with this product and would highly recommend the StarKist Tuna Chunk Light Pouch to others.\n",

      "This chai is both fragrant and flavorful. Each teabag is wrapped within its own sealed package to ensure freshness up until you actually decide \"it's time for chai.\" Unsealing the teabags produces and aroma that is reminiscent of Christmas for me - and why wouldn't it with Cinnamon, Ginger, and Cloves making up half the ingredients on the tea? The flavor is robust and sweet, leaving a little dryness behind as it slips beyond my uvula and into my belly (honestly, the back of my mouth \"tastes\" dry after I drink this, and I rather like that). Higgins and Burke chai leaves a pleasant aftertaste as well - always a plus.\n",

I was first introduced to beef jerky during MCT (Marine Combat Training)...which is where you learn warfighting techniques. For those LONG, sweaty, depressingly hot days in NC...this was an excellent snack. Beef Jerky is nutritious, low in fat content and tastes great! It also is a great chewy snack for those 'hurry-up-and-wait' days. Perhaps the biggest benefit for me was the salt....if you're out in the sun all day, you lose a lot of sweat....the Marine Corps motto should be 'drink water'...but as for electrolytes/ salt....this snack does an excellent job. I love the peppered taste...probably because I'm Jamaican. The 1.5-ounce snack size fits perfectly in your pocket and works out to be about half the price you'd pay at the gas station (thanks Amazon). I have a couple of buddies over in Afghanistan and I sent each two packs....for them and to pass around to their troops...they love it.<br />For a healthy snack (especially if you're very active and sweat a lot)this is a great product.<br />If there was one complaint....I wish the desiccant that is inside every bag was somehow shaped differently.....if you grab a handful in the bottom...you'll never know that you grabbed the desiccant too....luckily I've been able to catch it!\n",

It was enough to wake me from a sound sleep....in my three story house. I also noticed bloody poo some of the time. My daughter had similar problems with one of her cats. Her vet recommended NB Cat Food. It is the best!! Both of my cats looooooovvve it! While I cant' say the litter box is completely odor-free, the aroma is much more tolerable and within normal range of kitty smells. Both cats are grateful for the change.

      "This looks like real food! The chicken is actual chicken shreds, not some amorphous grey paste. The other TikiCat varieties are similar - the fish looks like fish, you can see pieces of leafy greens, etc.<br /><br />My cats love this. They also love the salmon, chicken+salmon, ahi tuna, and all the \"tuna on rice with ___\" varieties. I calculated the % calories from protein (vs. from fat/carbs), because I'm looking for the cat food that has the highest %cals from protein. Of the five TikiCat varieties I checked out, Hawaiian grill has the highest %cal from protein, followed by Napili Luau and PukaPuka Luau. The \"tuna on rice with __\" do have some carbs, since they have rice in them, but I still feed them to my cats every now and then for variety (and because they're less expensive!). My cats love all the TikiCat varieties I've given them, and I feel comfortable feeding this brand of cat food to my cats, since I can see what it's made of, there's no weirdness on the ingredients panel, and everything I've heard about the company (Petropics) makes it sound like they're really environmentally conscious.<br /><br />GreenLittleCat did a review of TikiCat, including a picture of what's inside the can. They also did a \"natural cat food showdown\" where they compared a bunch of natural cat food companies' environmental practices, and TikiCat won! Google them, since I feel uncomfortable linking to an outside site. (I have no affiliation with GreenLittleCat)\n",

      "I will not repeat the many positive reviews of this appliance.  I love it for the same reasons everybody else who loves it does:  one small appliance, no pots and pans, a few pieces into the dishwasher, no timing, no recipes, easy peasy.  I actually like that it makes a small amount of food.  If something is rejected, I don't have a gallon ziplock of useless food cubes taking up room in the freezer.  I'd rather have variety than bulk.  Plus, it's super easy to incorporate leftover meat or fish or rice with your fresh veggies and reheat/cook and puree together.<br /><br />I wanted to share, though, a little bit of research I did to make it even easier to use.  I like to make a couple of batches in a row so I can do combinations or single-veg purees with the same small group of ingredients.  What do you do when your already-peeled potatoes don't all fit?  Mix them with some zucchini or cauliflower and do a second mixed batch!  There are two logistical problems with this:  there is no information on the steamer basket's capacity so you can't chop the second or third batch in advance, and the \"measures\" of water are also not defined.  Since the mixing bowl is also the water measuring bowl, you would have to wash it out really carefully between uses to avoid getting food particles in the reservoir.  Other than protecting the cleanliness of the reservoir, it does not seem necessary to do more than a quick rinse if you're doing two vegetables in a row.  So I did a little \"science\" and found:  \"one measure\" of water is about 1/4 cup, 2 measures 1/2 cup, 3 measures 3/4 cup.  Also, the description says that the bowl has a 2.5 cup capacity.  Not so.  It is the *steamer basket* that has a 2.5 cup capacity.\n",

The small ham bits taste authentic and add a quite different taste and consistency to normally bland grits. They're instant so it only takes a minute or two to prepare and they go well as a side dish with eggs and biscuits or toast, or just served alone.

I also get the loose leaf version at (which is bolder) at Starbucks for under 7 dollars a tin. It is a nice mixed flavor of English Breakfast (Twinings brand is best for English Breakfast in my opinion) and ever so slightly Earl Grey and other black teas. The Tazo Awake black tea is not as strong as some but bold in flavor or aroma, the loose leaf version by Tazo is even more so. I don't drink caffeine in the form of sodas or coffee but I do drink lots of tea and I don't ever feel wired or caffeine'd out after a few cups of tea each day. Tazo has impressed with both their loose leaf and tea bag versions.

This Sugar Free syrup really makes the usual Vanilla Frozen yogurt a real gourmet treat.<br /><br />I purchased it and found that it works great in turning plain coffees into yummy mocha's. Add it to your milk and heat it slightly, then whip it to make a really tasty mocha latte.<br /><br />I gave it only 4 stars because it is sweetened with Maltitol, a \"sugar alcohol\" which can upset your stomach if you're sensitive, but I haven't had the problem, but I think if you use enough it can force frequent trips to the bathroom, if you know what I mean.  If it was sweetened with sucralose (Splenda) then it would get 5 stars from me.<br /><br />I look forward to trying their other flavors as this was a winner... I have since re-ordered in the \"6-pack.\"  It is also available in a larger size bottle that you can use a hand pump to dispense.<br /><br />I recommend it for any chocolate lover who is looking to top ice cream, yogurt, even coffee drinks!\n",

The pods were completely dried out, stiff and flat, not oily and supple as one expects of gourmet quality beans; I was afraid the beans would snap if bent.  There was no oily residue common in good quality vanilla beans.  Getting the caviar out of the pod is going to be tricky in this condition.  The color on the pods is less consistent than I would prefer.  The fragrance, while markedly vanilla, was diluted, likely due to the pods' overly dry condition.  I would suggest that the poor condition of the beans is likely due to the method they were packaged.  Vacuum sealing the beans would have protected them from drying out much better than a plastic bag with a simple zipper seal, which is far from air tight.  The beans are more of extract quality than of gourmet quality.  I am completely unimpressed.\n",

It is more expensive and less desirable (health and taste wise). Grade B is the second run with more minerals plus more maple taste. Grade C is the third run with even more minerals and an even stronger taste of maple and it's slightly less pleasant for most people.<br /><br />Maple syrup has a large variety of minerals and vitamins and Grade B Organic is my favorite, considering it's stronger flavor and higher nutrition content.

Shipping is expensive, but stale on the store shelf is 100% waste.<br /><br />Fallot is one of the top tier because of several factors:<br /><br />It is an independent mill in Burgundy.<br /><br />They source their particular strains of Brassica seeds carefully.<br /><br />They use verjuice instead of other liquids.<br /><br />The three pack is a better deal.  But, unless you use a lot of this mustard and fairly regularly, big is false economy.  Do not get a 13.5 oz jar if it takes you six months to use.

The bar is good for a quick snack if you're hungry between meals, and if you divide your meals up to five a day, then it's basically a meal.

More crumbly than the chocolate wafers. Kosher D from processing on shared equipment. 65 kcal per cookie. I put 2-4 cookies in zipper snack bags to make convenient portions. I save and reuse these snack bags for when I open the next \"big\" package. Easy to keep these fresh in an airtight cookie jar or gallon (4 ltr) ziplock bag.

      "Currently, this is the only K-Cup 50 pack listed as \"mild\" on Amazon. I was expecting something with only a little flavor and bitterness, but these K-Cups surprised me. They're not as strong as the bold or extra bold flavors, but the difference is reasonably subtle. They're certainly not bland or tasteless. Also, they do taste to me a little sweet and smoky - just as they are described above.<br /><br />A note about packaging: when I bought a Coffee People 50 pack from Amazon, the K-Cups came in only one box - a thick, corrugated cardboard Coffee People box. Amazon just stuck the mailing labels on the box and gave it to USPS. When this coffee arrived, the K-Cups were in a thin Timothy's cardboard box, which Amazon had put inside one of their standard corrugated cardboard boxes. The upshot is that these Timothy's 50 packs are mailed double-boxed, unlike the Coffee People 50 packs, and so it seems less likely that the Timothy's 50 packs will get damaged in the mail.\n",

You get lots of health benefits from drinking it daily: it is said to help with nausea, ease labor and delivery, and post- partum recovery. It is also helpful for regulating menstrual periods and controlling diarrhea. And as if that were not enough, it also acts as an astringent on irritated skin by tightening the top layers of skin or mucous membranes, it reduces secretions, relieves irritation, and improves tissue firmness. As a mouth wash, you can use it to soothe mouth and throat irritations.<br />It does not have much flavor, but you can pair it with mint leaves and it will tate very nice.

They work well with salsa, cheese, dips, and even by themselves. The chips are crispy, have a great texture, and they stand up to thick dips.  Despite being jalapeno, they are not too spicy and not too bland. These are just right. Highly recommend these chips!\n",

These are round, robust bags that sit purposefully at the base of the cup and mean business.  They contain real tea with real taste.  Make sure the water is boiling hot when you pour it on, give the bag a minute to soak - encourage it with a little squeezing - then add a drop of low-fat milk or a slice of lemon and enjoy a true cuppa, taking time to sneer at the poor, deluded fools around you, sipping at their pathetic rosehip infusions or vanilla flavored Lobsang Souchang Rama Gupta, or whatever it is.<br /><br />The shelf life is long enough for you to buy it in bulk, and Amazon's price is good, so treat yourself to a proper cuppa.

All you have to do is mix the ingredients together and put it in your fridge or freezer. It tastes good cold or frozen. It was a huge hit at my last dinner party. I served it for dessert and everyone loved it. Everyone, young and old, raved over it and asked for seconds. I thought that the pie would be too crunchy because the box contains a lot of crushed Oreos but it wasn't. The pie has just enough crunchiness to not overpower the smooth, creamy and rich flavor of the pie. It's not overly sweet and sugary tasting which I like. The only thing I would recommend is that you put this in an 8 to 9 inch round pie plate or something similar in shape so that the pie comes out looking better, if presentation matters to you. Plus, that's what the recipe called for anyway. I neglected to check that out in the store when I bought the mix. I didn't have a round pie plate so I used a 9-inch square Pyrex dish so the pie didn't look as good as the picture but thank goodness it still tasted awesome.\n",

      "A decent pasta with an average sauce (comparable to jarred).  Barilla is my usual pasta, and mezze penne something I always stock at home, so I was curious how their prepackaged meals are.<br /><br />The very brief (60-seconds) microwaving results in a penne a little softer than my usual al-dente, but surprisingly \"normal pasta\" despite coming out of a microwave package.  The sauce is a generic marinara.  Edible but nothing exciting, similar to jarred.  If you make your own sauces (which I highly recommend, very easy), this sauce will taste a bit \"fake\" to you.  It has only minor heat despite being labeled \"spicy\" (although that may be versus sugar-heavy old-fashioned American marinaras), but for us spice-lovers, I added both cayenne and red pepper flakes to get to the preferred level of zing.<br /><br />The microwave tray is a coated paperboard with a plastic insert for the sauce, so it's not all plastic (I try to avoid heating food in plastic when possible).  The serving is a lightweight 320 calories.  At my recommended 2500 calorie daily intake, this would qualify as a snack.<br /><br />These seem like they'd be expensive per \"meal\" compared to making pasta yourself, and too low-calorie to be a meal by themselves for most adults.  But still handy if you have poor kitchen access, or for brown-bagging to work/school.<br /><br />Recommended for a \"quick pasta meal\".\n",

      "I like these so much I enrolled in the Subscribe & Save over a year ago.  It is not the cheapest snack, but I save money by ordering these in bulk through Amazon rather than buying these from my local grocery store.  There are no artificial ingredients or added sugars; this is just fruit.  Yet, this is a great portable snack that will not go bad sitting in your car, or your child's backpack.  I usually keep a supply in my car to satisfy my huger while driving home from work.<br /><br />I completely disagree with the serving size listed on the package.  It claims five servings per bag.  But, if you're eating these as a snack, you'll only get one serving out of a package, maybe two servings if it's for a child.  If you're using this on top of cereal or yogurt, then of course it will last much longer.  When the bag is empty, you'll find a bunch of fruit powder left at the bottom.  Don't throw it away, this makes a great topping for yogurt.<br /><br />This snack is not for everyone.  My kids and I love them, but my husband can't stand them.  These are not the consistency of other dried fruits, like raisins.  These are crunchy, just as the name implies.  You can happily crunch them like potato chips, or to make them last longer, eat one at a time, and let them slowly dissolve in your mouth, like a sugar cube.  Sweet without the guilt.\n",

I would not really compare them to a caramel apple because with those, you get apple, caramel and peanuts in each bite.  With these, you get caramel and then the apple flavor.<br /><br />A couple things to keep in mind.  These are suckers you have to lick.  There's no chewing these and there's no putting them in your mouth and letting them melt.  If you leave them in your mouth for even a moment, the caramel sticks to your teeth and feels like it's going to pull out your fillings when you go to remove it.  The sucker will last longer than one you can chew, but you do have to work on the lollipop.  This isn't something you can enjoy while doing cross-stitch, for example.  You need one hand free to hold the stick at all times.<br /><br />Another thing - as you get down to the last little bit of sucker, it becomes sharp on the edges, so I would not advise giving these to children.  Lastly, because you do have to lick these from beginning to end, you are working on it for a while.  So the paper stick starts to fall apart right at the end.<br /><br />These small things aside, I would absolutely recommend these unusual but tasty suckers.  I certainly plan to buy more.\n",

I love these resealable containers although there are so many uses for Swanson Chicken Broth that you really won't find yourself having any leftover broth!  This particular product has less sodium which lends itself well to cooking.  Swanson's truly has the best chicken broth and using it can make a difference in the taste of your finished product.  If you need a quick throw together meal after a long day at work, warm up some broth and add some cornstarch (2T) (pre-mixed with water); add frozen peas and carrots and a can of chicken;  mix all together and pour into a refrigerator pie crust.  Bake at 375 until the crust is brown (about 30 minutes).  You'll have a delicious chicken pot pie without much effort.  Enjoy!\n",

If you do anyway, don't talk or laugh. haha It makes it hurt more. Fun to try though and it has a great taste. I recommend it to anyone that loves hot sauce and people that want to try it for fun. The amount I tried was probably about half the size of those taco bell packets(hopefully most people understand that amount) for one taco.\n",

      "Update 5/19/12: Enough of the crumbs already. Guess Pamela's has no interest in fixing the production. I'm canceling, there are better cookies.<br /><br />Update 3/20/12: My latest shipment arrived with no damage to the box, but some of the cookies were completely reduced to crumbs. Odd thing is in some cases a single 2-pack would have a whole or nearly whole cookie, and the other was totally crumbs. The manufacturer's production quality must be inconsistent, and it just takes a certain amount of shipment vibration to crumble the 'weaker' cookies. Odd thing is this is the first batch I've had that were so thoroughly reduced to tiny crumbs. Pamela's needs to tweak their manufacturing.<br /><br />Update 11/7/11: Ditto. Great product arrives intact. Keep shipping them in the display pack via USPS.<br /><br />Update 10/9/11: Ordered the 12 pack of 2 packs again, arrived in the same shelf display package, with intact cookies. Keep it up Amazon, this is working.<br /><br />Update 10/1/11: I took a chance and ordered another package. This one came in a long 'shelf display package', which was shipped USPS. If they stick to this packaging and shipping, I'll order these cookies regularly. So far every 2-pack has had whole complete cookies with minimal crumbs. Way to go, Amazon! I'll attach a picture under the 'customer pics'.<br /><br />Update 9/26/11: a second attempt resulted in larger cookie pieces, and one of the packages contained two whole complete cookies<br /><br />Original review: The 12 pack of 2-packs was delivered in a plastic bag. They must travel around Amazon in this fashion, and are reduced to crumbles as handled by Amazon. The bag was packaged in a large box along with a 6-pack of cereal boxes; there could have been more filler around the cookies bag, but I doubt it would help much if the cookie bag is tumbling around Amazon before shipment packaging.<br /><br />The cookies themselves were okay, not as good as nutter-butters. Can't really judge them as cookies when most all of them were broken. There were a few almost 'halves', but they were coated in crumbs. Some of the packages had melted chocolate. Basically you have to pour the packages out into a bowl and eat them with a spoon. I agree with the last reviewer, except, I'm willing to reorder in the future if Amazon can send a replacement shipment that arrives mostly or all intact.\n",

When my roommate saw what I was doing, he was all \"Hey, what are you doing?\" And I was like \"I'm gluing a bunch of flank steaks together to make a vest. what does it look like I'm doing\". The meat glue was easy to use and bonded the separate flank steaks together almost seamlessly. The resulting vest was quite sturdy and surprisingly water proof. I'm not sure if the glue had anything to do with that, or if meat is just naturally water proof. All I can say for sure is that the meat vest served its purpose, and I am happy with my purchase of this product. Anyone looking to glue separate pieces of meat together, for whatever the reason, might consider this product.\n",

The other night , I did not have time to bake them so I just put the batter in the fridge. The next day, just used a small icecream scooper to form small balls and put them on the sheet. I usually spray the small scooper with PAM and scoop up the dough and the balls will pop right out...have uniform size cookies!

But it's not easy to find decent cereal...most of them are high-salt, high-sugar, do-it-yourself health problems in a box.<br /><br />Was great to find E4:9's cereals! I've tried the flax and the cinnamon-raisin...both are great! Most of the time, I eat it cold with almond milk. But sometimes, I like mixing E4:9 about half 'n half with oat bran (I use Bob's Red Mill), adding almond milk, and popping it in the microwave for about three minutes. This stuff is great hot!<br /><br />One great thing besides knowing the cereal is crammed with nutrition and high fiber is that it fills you up but good...and sticks to your ribs for hours. A real help for losing weight.<br /><br />Some people won't like this kind of cereal. Too much like chowing down on twigs and weeds and sawdust, they fear. But the flavor is truly enjoyable. Add the milk, some fruit, and you'll have energy to last!<br /><br />Finally, I've compared local store prices against Amazon, and the local is far higher.\n",

I've found that going beyond the simply-flavored chips, like cheddar or vinegar, usually results in disappointment.  Tried the Thai or asian-inspired chips by Target, Archer Farms, and they were awful.  These Kettle Spicy Thai chips are just awesome...so much so, that I'm considering buying them in bulk from Amazon.  The taste is complicated and stimulates different parts of the palate.  The taste sensations prevalent in real Thai food is baked into this chip...sweet, salty, spicy.  Was sour in there too?  I don't know, but this is a well-made well-balanced chip that is addicting.\n",

It causes you to relax and take a deep breath. Therefore I find this tea good for stress relief. Each sip is really soul cleansing.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review\n",

It took no effort and in the end it was a great tasting and filling meal.  I did add more frozen vegetables because the broccoli flakes that came in the package were not enough vegetables for us.  The cheese has a fantastic taste; better than I had anticipated.  I usually shy away from cheesy dinners and was skeptical when I saw the package of thick cheese to add at the end of cooking this.  I actually think it was the cheese flavor that gave it the flavor that I really enjoyed.  I also enjoyed the thickness of the rice.  It was not the small flimsy rice but a thicker more hearty rice.  This also thickened up really quickly and the meal was ready in about 20 minutes.  My wife and myself had leftovers so I would estimate that this box could feed a family of three.  Overall I enjoyed tonights dinner and will use the coupon that came in the box to buy some more.\n",

      "These WOW Gluten Free Brownies are exquisitely delicious. They are at least as good as brownies made from wheat products, if not better. They are moist and chocolaty. There is no sour or flat taste that is common with many gluten free baked goods. Because there is no gluten there is a lack of chewiness that is common to some fudge brownies, but the moist mouthwatering taste is unsurpassed.<br /><br />I have given these gluten free brownies to people who are not gluten intolerant and they wanted more. WOW knows how to bake!<br /><br />The one caveat, if you are lactose intolerant, is that WOW uses butter as an ingredient. If a dozen are ordered, I would also recommend putting some in the freezer. It helps dissuade from eating all of them at once and keeps them around longer. These are absolutely \"finger lickin' good\"!\n",

      "As I have been sampling the Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans, one of the things I have discovered is that for me, at least, most of the flavors are too much of a good thing. I am a person who craves a little variety, so while I love the beans, I want more than just one flavor. That is where this selection and the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JBLLK6\">David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans Fruit Mix</a> work out very nicely for me.<br /><br />Instead of one flavor, we have the opportunity to mix and mingle our favorites, or simply enjoy the various flavors individually. whether you are a root beer fan, love orange crush, are craving a lemonade, or just want to enjoy any of the soda flavors, you will enjoy this particular mix.<br /><br />My favorite mixture is the fruit flavored one, but this comes in a close second.<br /><br />I am grateful to the distributor for a complimentary sample pack with all of the current flavors. As the only person in my house who eats jelly beans, this has given me the unique privilege of spending time getting to enjoy each flavor individually without worrying they will disappear when I'm not looking.<br /><br />While some of the beans are aimed at the adult palate, you will need to hide this assortment from the kids because this is one the whole family will enjoy.\n",

The flavor is earthy and delicious, with a subtle nutty aspect, derived from the roasted rice.  It is yellow, not green, in color; a large tablespoon is sufficient for a good-sized teapot.  You definitely want to use a teaball, as it comes loose-leaf from the box.  This tea is so satisfying, you need not add any sweetners.

I'd tried the Jyoti and found it tasted much to similar to MREs for my taste.<br />This stuff actually tastes like chicken tikka masala.  It's not perfect, but it's close enough.<br /><br />The biggest problem I had with it was the fact that they ship it with dry ice, and when that all evaporated... the boxes got soggy.  Compound this with the fact that the adhesive keeping the plastic covering on the bowl has the strength of watered down elmer's glue... I was in for a nasty mess when I opened the box.  So, out of the 12, I lost about three.<br /><br />I'm sure had I not shipped it all the way out to Iraq, they would have made it frozen and intact.

My C-2,3,4 and 5 discs were ruptured, but as a result of my youth I achieved what seemed at the time a complete recovery.  However, as the years have progressed, the injuries have taken their toll.  I have been to medical doctors and specialists repeatedly, but only for moderate and temporary relief of the pain from the grinding together of the discs.  The lengthiest relief I acquire is through massage  with the mustard rub and copious quantities of curcumin taken orally. The rub does work for me for several hours at a time.  The edge is taken from the pain and I'm able to go about a somewhat normal lifestyle (which does include regular PT exercises as well, but I've been able to dodge further surgery and addictive painkillers thus far).\n",

      "OK, so I'm a high school English teacher and a total Caribou addict.  There is not one in my city, but whenever I travel to Minneapolis, I hit a Caribou at least three times a day.  My school librarian got a Keurig coffee maker and made me a cup of this stuff.  I was immediately hooked!  I started buying boxes of these K-Cups so I could enjoy Caribou coffee all day long while teaching, and now students see a smile on my face, cup in hand, and my coffee-fueled lessons have been taken to a whole new level.  While I'm brewing my coffee, I communicate more closely with the librarian, and this has resulted in some collaborative efforts between myself and the librarian, particularly concerning research, which in turn positively impacts the education of my students.  I savor every delicious drop of my Caribou coffee while the other teachers choke down the weak and bitter rat pee in the teachers' lounge.  Guess who looks forward to coming to work every morning?  Thanks, Keurig, for making Caribou a part of my daily life!\n",

I like the fact that it is not over roasted and you can taste the bean and not just the bitterness from the roast.  Balance of ALL THE FLAVORS is key to a good cup of coffee.  Novices drink Starbucks (the over roasting kings).  I especially like the low acidity and complexity this kind of coffee offers over the central and south American coffees.  At the end of the cup I am satisfied with what I have just consumed.  If you like your coffee so strong it can lift a car then add more beans and/or grind them finer.  That way you will taste the complexities of the bean and the place on earth it came from.  To me when you judge the coffee based on the techniques of the roaster then you can put any bean in there and have a similar tasting product.  BTW, you can usually find this coffee cheaper at your local Marshalls.  But it is hard to argue with free 2 day prime shipping convenience.\n",

Lastly, I tried others and why I keep coming back to Cheribundi Tru Cherry is two-fold: this brand is made entirely of cherries/not from concentrate AND tastes FANTASTIC.

      "I love BFF by Weruva because it's incredibly healthy, with only quality meats and supplements and no grains or by-products, but is so much cheaper than any other \"premium\" brand of comparable quality out there.  I don't even know how they manage to keep the price so reasonable.  The difference in quality is obvious when you open the can, as the food hasn't been ground into unrecognizable oblivion but still has identifiably shredded meat and looks a healthy flesh color, not some unsatisfying 'blah' brown.  I'm a student, so I'm on a very tight budget, but it's worth it to me to purchase BFF for my cats because I believe in preventative care.  Feed my cats well from the beginning and they'll live long, healthy, happy lives with less health problems that will leave me with expensive vet bills.  As for now, my cats and kitten gobble it up in a second flat.  It's obvious they love every flavor I've tried with them (and one is even quite picky).  Their fur is like silk, too.

None of this coffee is ever bitter or acidic like Starbucks.  It's strong but as it's perfectly measured you never get that \"put too much coffee or too little water\" feeling.  It was interesting to see a CNBC special on Green Mountain, which also makes the Keurig brewers; they said the makers are sold literally at cost and they make their money off of the coffee.  Starbucks is now selling Kcups...for over a buck each!!  I say drop the Star and save some Bucks!\n",

Its been great now that I can get it through Amazon and save my friend the hassle of packing it up and sending it to me. Cheaper too since shipping is free.

Or just add water and drink! I do not have fancy lab instruments to verify authencity ( NMR testing can actually trace the carbon to the poemegrante tree).  The label claims 100% pomegranate.  In my opinion, labels are not always true.  Other brands list, sugar, flavors, ..etc.<br /><br />Compared to other stuff I tried, this is is good.. I have one pomegranate tree in my backyard and I make my own juice whenever I have the fruit.  This taste good but nothing like the real stuff.  This does not mean it is fake however, the high temperature cooking process they use does affect the taste.  Plus there are many varieties of pomegranates out there, some sweet, some tart, some blonde, some red..etc.  If you have access to the real pomegranates, I suggest you make your own, otherwise buy this.  Making pomegrante juice is easy in a blender, but it cost alot to buy the fruit, if you can find it\n",

      "Since having our son 4 years ago, it's been even more important to give our dogs organic healthy food.  The reason for this is for some reason, my son thinks since the dogs eat the food, he can too.  I've tried following this with snacks as well, but we have rather picky dogs.  Most organic or holistic treats are met with either a turned up nose, or eaten without enthusiasm.<br /><br />I loved the ingredients in these (organic lamb, organic barley, and other organic ingredients).  So I thought I'd give them a try.  As soon as I opened the bag, my dogs came running.  I can easily break them in half so the treats are a little smaller (although they are still too large to be good training treats), and my dogs sat, stayed, then came when called to get at these new treats.  They repeated this process several times, which is all I can ask from any treat, especially one that is so healthy.  These treats are scored in the middle, so it is easy to break them.<br /><br />And yes, my 4 year old son did take one and try it, and he says they are really tasty too!  Our dogs are both 75 pounds (a very picky Akita/husky mix who won't even eat raw meat, and a big brown mutt that doesn't like peanut butter), so I'm not sure if these treats would be as good for small breeds.  The pieces when broken in half are a little over an inch square.\n",

She'll eat this any time of the day, and we're happy she's getting a good balance of vitamins and minerals.  Most jarred baby food is pretty light on the calories and nutrition, but the plain cereals that are fortified with essential vitamins/minerals are so boring and don't train a baby to enjoy different flavors.  We've been mixing cereal into our baby's food to enhance the nutrition, but that's inconvenient and messy.  This Wholesome Breakfast provides the best of both worlds:  the vitamins/minerals of a fortified cereal but with the stronger flavors of a real food.

I started drinking about 3 ounces each morning, hoping to notice some reduction of discomfort; unfortunately, that never came. However, I've been cold-free and virtually sick-free ever since. At times, when I've been directly exposed to people coughing, sneezing, and suffering from various ailments, I have experienced the initial signs of a cold, but that's as far as it progresses. Within a day, my health is restored and I'm feeling strong once again.<br />I highly recommend Goji - all it takes is a few sips in the morning to stay healthy and feel great.\n",

      "I must echo the praise of Lipton Yellow Label tea.<br /><br />I don't know how this label may differ across countries, but recently I spent several month-long trips to Pakistan, where Lipton Yellow Label is pretty much all the black tea they serve, and tea is served all the time.  After getting around the initial shock of their custom of putting up to four teabags into 16 ounces of water there, I came to like the Yellow Label tea.  Then when switching a few times to Twinings tea at the hotel business center, I realized that Yellow Label is much better than all the tea I'd been drinking heretofore.  Comparing Yellow Label to other Litpons, other tea available in America, and even Twinings, which I considered the top of the heap, Yellow Label was clearly better.  A Pakistani friend who travels to the U.S. says that American tea is \"insipid\" and refuses to drink it.  I now agree, and think that Lipton Yellow Tea is the best tea I have ever had.  Now I've got to figure out where to buy it.  As far as I'm concerned, Yellow Label is the tea most worth drinking, which no doubt accounts for its popularity in Pakistan.\n",

Perhaps if enough people start purchasing these, the price will come down a bit. The grass fed beef does not taste gamey either. I do wish they were certified organic though. My guess is that they are from organic cows on small farms but these farms don't want to pay for organic certification due to price.\n",

      "Most cat owners know the benefits of grass for their feline's digestive health.  Animals that are strictly indoor residents don't have easy access to grass, so it's up to their owners to supplement this need for their pets.  Most pet stores carry some type of 'ready to use' oat grass, however a combination of overwatering and artificial light in stores causes heavy mold growth at the base of the grass and on the root system, limiting life of the product and producing health concerns for both pet and owner.<br /><br />To avoid such issues, I've been in search of a good cat grass to grow at home.  After going through several other exceptionally poor products, I gave the Petlinks system a try.  The system comes enclosed within a round white plastic tub and contains everything you need to grow grass (container, soil, oat seed) except water.  The instructions are simple and clear, and allow individuals with 'brown-thumbs' to produce a lush, thick green product.<br /><br />The first step is to poke some small holes in the bottom of the container.  The product instructions indicate 4-6, however since I used a very small object (turkey skewer) to make the holes I ended up making ~15 holes across all areas of the container the bottom to allow for sufficient drainage. In the second step, you plant the seeds; the product instructions indicate you \"stir in the seeds, ensuring most are covered\".  If that is followed as stated, it could cause variability in the extent of your yield; while you may get sufficient growth, it probably wouldn't be optimal as it would be difficult to get sufficient soil coverage of the seeds.  A better idea is to remove about 1/4\" to 1/2\" of soil from the container (using a tablespoon) before sprinkling the seeds on the surface of the remaining soil in the container; lightly cover the seeds with the soil you removed to complete the planting process. By doing this, it ensures all the seeds are sufficiently covered and will grow to their maximum capacity.  The final steps are to place the container on a small saucer, water the soil with 1/4 cup water, loosely place the lid on the tub, and place the entire thing in a warm dark place (I used a kitchen cupboard).  Expect to see sprouts emerge in ~3 days (it will be quite evident as they push the lid up with their growth); once that happens just remove the lid, move the entire unit to a sunny location and keep the soil slightly moist.  You'll get full growth in ~7-10 days, though it will vary as some of the seed germinate faster than others.  This is actually a benefit as it makes the system more robust and provides a thick growth of the product due to the staggered sprouting.  Best of all, cats love it!  I've had to break up a couple fights between my two cats already over the first harvest.  :)  I've posted some photos of a 10-day growth (with a ruler included for scale) so you can judge the end result for yourself.<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br /><br />Pros:<br />  - Easy to use<br />  - Goof-proof instructions<br />  - Thick, healthy product that grows fast<br />  - Cats love it!<br /><br />Cons:<br />  - None\n",

      "I recently got a miniature Australian Shepherd puppy, and he's been teething a lot due to his baby teeth coming in.<br /><br />I'd read that rawhide is generally not recommended, as it can upset a dog's stomach. I read statements by Cesar Milan and others that bully sticks were preferable to rawhide.<br /><br />These bully sticks are great!  My puppy seems to prefer them to his chew toys as his number one chewing item...  He will chew on one for an hour, and it seems to help his teething and some anxiety. They do have a slight smell, but nothing overpowering, and his strong preference for them makes it well worth it. They also seem to last a very long time (after a week or so, we are still on the first stick, and it looks to last at least another week or two).<br /><br />I did notice today that on rare occasions, the dog can pull at thr side of the strip and get a stringy bit that's probably more than he should swallow...  This very rarely happens (ive only seen it once in a week), but it goes without saying, if possible keep an eye on the dog while he's chewing on these, just in case.\n",

Wines fermented with the K1V-1116 have very low volatile acidity, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and foam production.<br /><br />The K1V-1116 strain tends to express the freshness of white grape varieties such as Sauvignon Blanc, Chenin Blanc and Seyval. The natural fresh fruit aromas are retained longer than with other standard yeast strains. Fruit wines and wines made from concentrates poor in nutrient balance benefit from the capacity of K1V-1116 to adapt to difficult fermentation conditions. Restarts stuck fermentations.<br /><br />Highly recommended for dry whites, aged reds, and late harvest wines.\n",

      "I'm on Keto, consuming less than 10 carbs per day (and feeling awesome!).  These are a terrific addition to my diet.  A terrific way to cut half the calories/fat in your meal is to supplement your meal with these noodles. I have tried all three varieties. The only difference is the form.  They are easy to \"make\".  Just add sauce or stir-fry.  The liquid smell is gross, but it washes off nicely. Are they the equivalent of pasta? No!  But pretty damn close considering that they have nothing in them.  I've also made pizza crust using these noodles. Mmmm goood.\n",

      "That was the day a friend told me about Dreamfields pasta.  I don't have to worry about blood sugar; my angle is the low-carb diet.  I tried the Dreamfields angel hair with the White Linen [odd brand name for a spaghetti sauce] marinara sauce from Costco; it too has a low carb count. And of course a generous hit of fresh parmesan. The result was delicious, low carb, and very easy.  I noticed no midnight starvation, luckily.  Everything my friend and these reviewers said about this pasta being indistinguishable from regular pasta is true. I'm going to look for the linguini so my husband can make his perfect fettucini alfredo -- his is the best I've ever had. Linguini will just have to do, as there is no fettucini -- and it will.\n",

I tried it a few months ago and only had one cup and was pretty sure I liked it and wanted to confirm.<br /><br />I got this to use in my Cuisinart that is made for keurig k cups - I cut open the pods and poured the coffee into my set reusable kcup. Because the coffee is ground so fine, it didn't work too well in the keuring but I expected that. I just brewed two small cups with the one kcup-ful and it worked fine. The coffee is rich and full bodied, not bitter and only mildly acidic. And, it tastes pretty fresh for preground coffee.<br /><br />I love a deep, bold coffee but don't like acidic or bitter flavor, and this was a pretty good cupful, and it's organic to boot. I find it a challenge to find a bold coffee that I like that isn't bitter/acidic, so was pleasantly surprised with this. I would probably buy again if I could use pods directly or if I could get whole beans.\n",

I eventually noticed the slit at the top, which facilitates opening by pulling it open on the side.<br /><br />I am giving this 4 stars because I had a problem stopping eating these, and as a result I got a nasty sugar head ache and an icky feeling in my tummy. If I had more self discipline, I would have given these 5 stars, but they are irresistible.\n",

This is a healthy treat (in moderation, of course) and allows you to give your dog cheese without treading in \"human food\" territory, which many of us try to avoid.  You can fulfill the craving while still maintaining some semblance of order....  This is a fantastic treat, definitely the best cheese-related dog snack I've come across yet.  Great job!\n",

      "Like many regular tea drinkers I prefer the loose-leaf variety when I am at home, but the afternoon cuppa at work calls for something a little less complicated.  I am OK with sacrificing flavor for convenience, while saving some pennies at the same time.<br /><br />So far, I have been pleasantly surprised by Stash's brands of Certified Organic green teas.  I have drank both this straight green tea and the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDK6\">Stash Premium Organic Earl Grey Black and Green Tea</a> combination.  The teas come from the Yamamotoyama Brazilian tea gardens, which were initially planted with Japanese seedlings.  The processing methods and standards are all based on Japanese system.<br /><br />The flavor of this Premium Green Tea is really nice, with a subtle grassy flavor that I enjoy in decent green teas.  I find that too many American-produced green teas are \"watered down\" in flavor, lacking the oomph that one finds in a true Japanese or Chinese green tea.  This cup, however, is close to the real thing. It also gives off a nice green color, which is always a good sign.<br /><br />By no means the best tea you will ever drink, but this Premium Green Tea might just possibly the best inexpensive tea-bag style green tea on the market.\n",

I use the handle of a spoon, scoop out a small portion and simply roll it in my hands with the meds. The meds end up rolled in a neat little ball! He absolutely loves taking his meds now! I was thrilled to find I could order this online,which is much less of a hassle and less expensive too! He loves the chicken. My vet ran out of it and I tried beef, no go. I have used this for several years. I used to dread pill time, now he looks forward to it! He actually sits by the kitchen island every morning waiting for his \"treat\"!!!!!

I did a little bit of research on the prices and taste of some other brands of syrup versus the Hawaiian Shaved Ice syrups and these are the best by far.<br /><br />Some of the others were too sweet while some others were too weak and when you put it on the shaved ice, it was just lightly flavored.  But not so with Hawaiian Shaved Ice syrups.  Perfect for your sno cones every time you use it as it is not too sweet or not to weak.<br /><br />The product was delivered promptly and a few bottles had a split cap and I contacted the company and they promptly replied.  Nothing spilled during shipping as they are sealed on top.  But it was very nice of them to contact me so quickly as I was just letting them know that some of the caps were damaged during shipping.  Excellent customer service!<br /><br />The only small drawback is the shipping cost.  I know I bought 10 bottles of syrup but it was a bit pricey.  Other than that, the product was promptly shipped and received it a few days later.  I am happy with the syrup and this company!\n",

Without the almost-bitter notes of the Fogbuster, this Kona blend is complex, rich and delicious.<br /><br />For a 12 cup drip coffeemaker, I use two and a quarter coffee scoops of the beans and grind for 15 seconds.  It's perfect, and way better than Maxwell House or Folgers.  Highly recommended!\n",

      "I have 2 spayed, female cats. Neither are vigorous diggers, there are two large litter pans side by side. Neither cat is fussy about litter type.<br /><br />Pluses:<br />-- flushable (my top reason for use, I don't have trash service)<br />-- acceptable clumping (but I have never used the clay litters to compare)<br />-- non toxic & no lung choking perfumes (I am bothered by potent odors)<br /><br />Minuses:<br />-- cost<br />-- to eliminate odor you must add an additional product<br />-- for best results you have to clean box daily<br />-- cost (it's a byproduct of wheat production that is likely swept up off a factory floor somewhere, wrapped in a fancy brand name and sold at TOP DOLLAR)<br /><br />Notes & Suggestions:<br /><br />-- I have found that the urine sinks to the bottom and sticks there. If I tip the box so the dry litter is out of the way, then I can scoop out just the clumped litter and any granules that break off. This helps to reduce odor.<br />-- Every time after I scoop the box, I sprinkle baking soda over the top. I find that it sticks to the pee soaked clumps, so it must be replenished.<br />-- I don't put new litter in every time... instead I let the level get lower and lower. Then at the end of the week, I completely dispose of everything in the box, wash the box with diluted bleach and soap, refill with fresh litter.<br />-- Without baking soda, this stuff does small like warm bread that's been peed on... I can't imagine what the corn based stuff must smell like?! I have smelled corn based products (cat food, corn gluten fertilizer, chicken food & chicken poop which smells identical BTW, etc..) and they are revolting to me. Personal preference.<br />-- I pour my bags right into a galvanized, sealed can. I have not had any problems with insects. Although I can imagine that it would easily be an issue if it is not kept in a sealed container.<br />-- I did find evidence of a mouse getting into the litter box. I dealt with him, and do not have any mouse issues in my house. If you already battle with these creatures, it could be a concern.<br />-- If I leave the box more than two days without cleaning, I do experience the gooey state of clumping. This litter was a COMPLETE bust at my sister's house. She has 4 cats, 2 boxes and doesn't like to clean on a daily basis.<br /><br />POSSIBLE CHEAPER ALTERNATIVE:<br />--Today, when I picked up a new bag, and was griping about the cost and how cheap I am, the clerk at the feed store mentioned a cheaper alternative. Apparently they have a customer that buys chicken food, and uses that in her boxes. It's a grain based crumble that effectively works the same. The most compelling part being that 50# costs about $16.00, give or take. I got home, looked it up online and there are threads about how it works. I think I'll try that out next time.\n",

Being such a hard plastic, I was sure that none of the dogs would enjoy it at all.  I put peanut butter on it hoping that would at least get them to realize it was something for their mouths and handed it to our 6 month old Pitbull.  She licked the peanut butter off then went back to the old bone.  When my son took her to bed, he took the bone too.  The next morning I found the bone back in the living room and it had been gnawed on enthusiastically.  She loves it!  She's put hours in on it and it's nowhere near being chewed up yet - just chewed on.  Now when the yellow lab takes the kong and the chocolate lab takes the rubber bone, she has her own (very phallic looking) toy.\n",

      "Like many regular tea drinkers I prefer the loose-leaf variety when I am at home, but the afternoon cuppa at work calls for something a little less complicated.  I am OK with sacrificing flavor for convenience, while saving some pennies at the same time.<br /><br />So far, I have been pleasantly surprised by Stash's brands of Certified Organic green teas.  I have drank both this straight green tea and the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDK6\">Stash Premium Organic Earl Grey Black and Green Tea</a> combination.  The teas come from the Yamamotoyama Brazilian tea gardens, which were initially planted with Japanese seedlings.  The processing methods and standards are all based on Japanese system.<br /><br />The flavor of this Premium Green Tea is really nice, with a subtle grassy flavor that I enjoy in decent green teas.  I find that too many American-produced green teas are \"watered down\" in flavor, lacking the oomph that one finds in a true Japanese or Chinese green tea.  This cup, however, is close to the real thing. It also gives off a nice green color, which is always a good sign.<br /><br />By no means the best tea you will ever drink, but this Premium Green Tea might just possibly the best inexpensive tea-bag style green tea on the market.\n",

      "I gave the product 5 stars in an earlier review and am updating it. I was looking at the product I received from Amazon, which was placed at the doorstep in a hot sunny day. I asked myself if I've researched into the plastic used. Glad to know that it doesn't contain BPA. Recycling #7 can be good or bad plastic. I've read that it's best to go with #1, #2, #4 and #5 plastics. So I decided to err on the safe side. I am giving this a 3-star because it's probably not a big deal but since I know about it, I don't want to live with that uncertainty that I may be harming my baby.<br /><br />Previous review:<br />My baby ate 5 tiny spoons of it the first time he tried the peas. After that, it kinda got boring for him and then I mixed it in with his cereal, and he ate it all. I would describe the taste as non-offending. It is neither sweet nor sour and is mild tasting to be one of the first foods to introduce.<br />I had thought the product would contain only organic peas and water, but it has more (like tuna oil etc.). I guess that's alright. We use quite a few vegetables and fruits from Earth's Best and I think it's good to offer different brands.\n",

(It's fun to taste it \"raw\", it's cool on the tongue.) I use xylitol in my cookie, brownie, muffin, whipped cream, and other similar type recipes. I have not used it in custards or candies. The recipes I've used xylitol in come out great - the flavor and texture are uncompromised. I most often use xylitol with rapudura sugar in my recipes. I do this because some of my friends are sensitive to xylitol's mild laxative affect. I personally don't react to xylitol in that way, but I do have a couple of friends that experience bloating after eating my brownies that have xylitol substituted for the sugar. So, now I substitute 1/2 xylitol and 1/2 rapudura sugar in my cookie and brownie recipes and my friends don't have any adverse intestinal response. (Yay!)  Also, when eating desserts with xylitol, I don't experience a \"sugar headache\". I have had no adverse reactions while using this product. It's a fantastic sugar substitute.\n",

They are both just lightly sweetened, and fragrant with either the cinnamon or the vanilla, depending on which you choose. The container is marvelous; there is a half flip top which is easy to do with one hand (like in the car). And they're not roasted in more oil, so the almonds are \"meaty\" and sweet. And almonds are SOOO good for you. I'd recommend that you try them, and then get an Amazon subscribe and save if you can. It's well worth it! And all natural. LOVELY!\n",

The light botanical blend is the perfect balance between juice and sparkling water. There is no added sugar. It's all natural. The Orange Mate, also called \"Awaken\", is the ultimate beverage for maintaining good hydration and a healthy balance without consuming added sugar and artificial ingredients. It is not a traditional energy drink. It has less caffeine than a cup of decaf coffee. The natural caffeine is from the botanical extracts. No jittery feelings and post-buzz crash as with the traditional energy drink. Just smooth, steady natural energy.

I'd imagine kids would too.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- No high fructose corn syrup.<br />- Crunchy little bite-sized cookies.<br />- Nice chocolate taste that's not fake.<br />- Great to eat in the car, at your desk, or wherever.  It's a portable snack.<br />- Sweet but not sickeningly so.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- I really have no cons other than they will get stale if you don't wrap the bag up tightly.<br /><br />OVERALL OPINION:<br />I enjoy Chocolate Teddy Grahams as either dessert, or a snack with a cup of coffee.  It's a sweet pick-me up that doesn't leave me feeling too guilty.  Cures the need for chocolate, and has a nice crunch that sometimes I really want.  Oh yeah, and they're cute little bears!\n",

And there is no need to boil water here - in fact cold water is probably desirable. Simply add cold tap water and microwave for 4 minutes (no stirring or whatever) and it's ready to eat.

      "::::::UPDATED 9/8/2012:::::::: No longer fake solution being used. Real thick solution now::::::::Read below original comment.<br /><br />The 3 pack of Dove for Men Liquid Soap was opened already and was far more liquidy then the store bought brand. Normally this soap is much thicker, but the soap available on Amazon seems to have a thinner viscosity(like someone added water to it). It's like someone took 1-2 bottles and added water to them to make them fit into 3 bottles. The 3 pack I received had Skotch clear tape holding the lids on and I believe if this wasn't on the thin formula that Amazon provides of this Soap would more than likely leak out if this wasn't done. This soap isn't cheap and the 3 pack sounds like a deal, but when you get it you'll realize why. By buying it on Amazon you save some money, but your getting screwed since the soap is not the original Dove for Men formula, but instead a much more watered down version of this soap. A real disappointment!<br /><br />:::::UPDATE::: After running out of the water downed Dove for Men 3 pack I had, I decided to give Amazon one more try.  Since a year has passed and the price is amazing, I figured I'd see if the solution was still a problem and I can gladly say it's now the real thing. The Dove for Men solution they are now using is the same thick solution you can find in stores. Thanks for fixing this Amazon.\n",

Inside, I found air pillows and a smaller but still quite large package that had been labeled \"Ready to Ship\" after shrink wrapping.  Under the shrink wrap there were two smaller boxes that had zip perforations to make them easy to open, but these had been taped over with the strong plastic tape so I had to hack in with my scissors.  Inside each I found six cardboard boxes of the rice snax.  Opening one of these boxes, I found a sealed foil pouch.  Fortunately, that was not hard to open.  The crackers are oniony and tasty, and I am happy to find a way to get the gluten-free stuff I need at a volume price, but now I have all this cardboard to put into recycling.  A single cardboard box to hold 12 pouches inside would have been fine.  Amazon, you can help save the planet by reducing all this packaging.

      "I drink water from my jug as I work through long days, and I love water so much, I usually drink more from a glass when I get home as well. Water is my drink of choice.<br /><br />This Essentia pH balanced water has an advantage over plain water when it comes to refreshment. I've read about the scientifically most agreeable level of pH in water before, but I had never tried any of it until now.<br /><br />Having had jugged tap water until I was blue in the face that hot workday, I figured there would be no better time to try my Essentia once I got home and I was all watered-out. In every bit of honesty, I savored this bottle of water. I chugged, at a reasonable pace, every drop. I found it delicious, smooth and refreshing.<br /><br />Sure, it's more than just water; actually, it's purified water, sodium bicarbonate, dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate and calcium chloride. That's what it takes to achieve the perfect pH that makes it so easy to glide through all six servings these 1.5 liter bottles provide. Like most commercial beverages, this one has a formula as well, and it works out great.<br /><br />In the end, it's still water, but there is something favorable about water with a pH of 9.5. When chilled, this stuff is remarkably enjoyable. If you're a water connoisseur and you buy bottled water anyway, then definitely try Essentia - it's very nice.\n",

I tried to find it in the bricks and mortar stores, and they don't seem to have it or even know what I am talking about.  I even checked the bulk candy place in the mall (which seems to have gotten very expensive), yet even they didn't seem to know.<br /><br />Nitwitz works well as a \"candy dish\" candy because the pieces are solid (no candy dust) and don't seem to leave a residue in the dish (like a gummy candy might).  These are very similar to Willy Wonka Runts, but somewhat smaller and more tart.  The only issue with it is that it seems that the oranges make up an outsize percentage of the mix.  I suppose that it is possible that buying it from the machine somehow filtered out the larger orange pieces.  Also, the orange pieces are more like jawbreakers and I will have to warn guests about trying to bite down on them right away.  The other pieces are not quite as hard.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with the 2.5 lbs. mix and it should last me for several months.

So I did, but I had a very bad migraine that night and learned that headaches and trance are not a happy union. The collective eventually grew on me and that was around the time when their first CD Minologue came out. Shoot forward four years, and along comes Colours. This CD is pimp. It is much more dance-friendly in my opinion than other things Son Kite have created. While Minologue was flat-out psychedelic trance, Colours ventures out into different genres. I can hear tidbits of progressive house, epic trance, and even a jazzy feel in these nine songs. Personal favorites include Jukebox, Games and Watch, and Focus. <p>I recommend this CD to anyone who is a fan of somewhat underground dance music.\n",

      "I recently discovered Darn Good Chili Mix at a local store.  It is tasty just using the directions on the bag, which is just the chili mix, water, and a can of tomato paste.  It makes roughly 8 cups of chili, which is enough for the 3 adults in our family.  If you're following the new 2011 Weight Watchers plan, 1 cup of chili is 2 points when made according to those directions.<br /><br />However, I like it better as a base for my own chili.  Here is how I make it:<br /><br />2 lbs of ground sirloin (90% lean)<br />1 lbs of ground venison (or substitute more ground beef)<br />1 large sweet onion, chopped<br />2 large green peppers, chopped<br />5 or 6 heaping teaspoons of fresh minced garlic (I use the jarred garlic that needs refrigerated)<br /><br />Toss all of the above in a large skillet, and cook over medium heat until meat is done.  Drain any grease and sit aside.<br /><br />In a large pot, add 14 cups of water.  Bring to a boil.<br /><br />Whisk in 2 bags of Darn Good Chili Mix, and 2 cans of tomato paste.  Simmer for 15 minutes, stirring every couple of minutes.<br /><br />After 15 minutes, add:<br />15 oz can dark red kidney beans, drained and rinsed<br />15 oz can light red kidney beans, drained and rinsed<br />28 oz can of diced tomatos<br />28 oz can of Rotel tomatoes<br />Meat mixture<br /><br />Stir together and continue to simmer for another 20 minutes, stirring every couple of minutes.<br /><br />This makes a lot of chili.  My 8 1/2 quart pot was nearly full.  I always make extra chili so I can freeze part of it for a future meal.\n",

      "What a surprise this was! I have a love affair with chipotle sauce, so I was really looking forward to trying out Taco Bell's Chipotle Sauce and I have to say how much I enjoyed it! I tried it on some tacos we made for dinner last night and it really spiced them up! Changed the flavor and really brought out the ground beef we were using, they were so good that hubby asked if we could try it as a sandwich spread for lunch today. So how was that sandwich? As a spread I have to warn you not to add too much for it does make the bread a little soggy if you make your lunch the night before, but it really adds a flavor boost to your food. The flavor is a spicy and very slightly smoked bold chipotle taste. If I was ranking it between Taco Bell sauce packets I would have to say this is ranked between Hot & Fire. If you're a Mild type person then I would personally stay away from this sauce for it was not mild at all.<br /><br />Can't wait to try it on many different things, up next is a chicken salad with corn salsa! Mmm we expect many great things out of our bottle!\n",

      "I bought a massive box of these in my enthusiasm for chocolate-covered gummi bears.  It sounded like quite a bargain compared to paying for bears by the oz. at the local candy store.  I had never seen these packaged and boxed -- only unpackaged in plastic bins.  Sadly, the boxed bears were disappointing.<br /><br />They're disappointing because the quality of the chocolate is poor.  There is little coverage of the bears, and the chocolate is not a rich, milk chocolate, but some chocolate-like brown confection, much like orange drink hardly compares to actual juice.<br /><br />The bears are also non-traditional and lacking because of it. The flavor is a little bit off, and their shape is squashed -- not dimensions of more original gummy bears.<br /><br />If you have no other option besides these, I'd say go ahead and buy the bears.  Or if you are introducing chocolate covered gummy bears to someone who finds the idea inconceivable, sure, give them a try.  Maybe you need all the extra packaging for hygiene reasons.<br /><br />But if you've had real gummy bears covered in real chocolate, these are going to disappoint.\n",

It doesn't even taste like real Tequila - I don't even know what that thing is, but I definitely hate it and it causes me the worst hangovers.<br /><br />Tequila Herradura is one of the best Tequila producing houses in Tequila Jalisco (the best one in my opinion), and this one (Herradura Selecci&oacute;n Suprema) is to Tequila like Cognac is to wine. It has a lot of body and an extremely good flavor. While it's strong, it doesn't burn like plain alcohol.

I've eaten Indian cuisine before as one reviewer suggested I like it spicy. Therefore, I added .5 (half) tablespoon of chili pepper to the mixture and it gave it the kick I expect from Indian food. I only bought one packet of this and now wish I bought more. Also, the packet says use boneless meat but on the front is a picture of drumstick floating in the sauce so next time, I will use other cuts of chicken.\n",

I used to mix them 1/2 &  1/2.  That made them sweet enough for me.<br /><br />I do enjoy them right out of the box, like candy.  It helps with my craving for chocolate.

      "Our cat, Isabel, has struggled with UTI and weight issues for years. After our vet recommended a wet food only diet, we experimented with a variety of brands (included Rx), but could never find a wet food that made Isabel feel full, and not spend the rest of the day begging us for more food.<br /><br />Then we tried Wellness canned food.<br /><br />Isabel loves it (but she loves anything that resembles food, so that's not a huge hurdle), but what is great about Wellness is it fills her up! And not only has she stopped constantly begging for food, she started to lose weight! Her dandruff is going away, she is no longer lethargic and has started to play again, and she generally seems like a happier cat.<br /><br />Now that her chronic UTI has finally cleared up, we give her mostly Wellness canned food with a little bit of dry food mixed in. This is still her primary source of food, and she is just as happy now as when we first made the switch.\n",

When I have the time I use unflavored protein powder in a smoothie, but for days where that's just not possible Orgain has been an excellent substitute. I have tried chocolate and mocha, and both are great tasting. I prefer the mocha because I feel like I'm getting my coffee fix for the day--and though this stuff is caffiene free I feel energized without the jitters! It's a good breakfast, though occassionally I get an upset stomach after drinking it. I haven't been able to pinpoint why, but it's something to keep in mind if you have a sensitive stomach.<br /><br />I also drink orgain on my workout days, half a shake beforehand and the other half afterward. Even though it's expensive, I don't drink it every day, and my monthly subscription for just a 12-pack has done me well for a while now. For me, it's worth the money to have meal replacement that is easy and tasty.\n",

I skipped the direction step that said to rinse the noodles first and just dumped the packed into the bowl, added water till the water line, and microwaved it for 90mins as indicated. Everything turn out great except for the tofu after stirring the noodle a few times before consuming; the tofu remained hard. Next time I'll add some real tofu.<br /><br />A couple complaints: The bowl gets really hot after it's microwaved. Yes, of course it should get hot but I'm comparing this to other instant microwavable meals. This was much hotter and I had to get a plate to place the bowl onto to carry it. Be warned!

      "PetSafe Lickety Stik is a weird looking dispenser full of a delicious liquid treat my pooches are crazy about.  The strange design is slightly bigger than a deoderant bottle and the dogs get their treat by licking the roll-on ball!<br /><br />I own Wonderland Kennels, with 7 Boston Terriers and German Shepherds that I train and compete with.  Even the picky ones love this stuff.  The bottle is small, but it goes a loooong way because the pups are only getting a little at a time, instead of a larger treat.<br /><br />Pacino and Molly (German Shepherds) first instincts were to try to bite down on the dispenser, but it didn't crack and is still holding up fine.  They quickly learned to just lick it, though the best way to introduce it to larger dogs is to hold it completely upside-down so the angle makes it easier to lick and harder for them to grab.<br /><br />I'm honestly surprised by how big a hit this little Lickety Stik is with my pups, and how long the bottle lasts.  Maizy, Molly, Gracie, Pixi, Einstein, Pacino, and Isabelle each give it four paws up!  :)\n",

So imagine my surprise and delight when I opened a packet of Meow Mix Savory Morsels and had to fend off an attack from these suddenly ravenous beasts.

The vanilla is more of a light undertone as opposed to sitting side-by-side with the blackberry flavor. I've only drank it hot with Splenda and it exceeded my expectations. I didn't overdo the water (about 6oz.) and it resulted in a strong flavor that was really pleasant.<br /><br />The tea bag is made out of a material that isn't as messy as typical tea bags.

      "I grew up in New York City, and fondly remember the jingle, \"Conta-dina...tomato...sauce....New York's...best...selling...brand!\"<br /><br />This is Contadina Tomato PASTE, of course, not the sauce -- but it's made by the same people, and, unlike the tomato sauce, I have actually tried the Contadina Tomato PASTE.<br /><br />Tomato paste is similar in all brands.  Look at the ingredient panel.  The ingredient (usually), is just \"tomatoes\".  The only exception are brands like \"Muir Glen\", (also sold on Amazon.com), which is Organic. (Sadly, \"Del Monte\"-a large corporation -- also sold organic tomato paste for a while, but no longer does.  Please sell it again, Del Monte -- and I, and I'm sure many others -- will buy it!)<br /><br />In the meantime, Contadina tomato paste is as good as any other.  In some ways, it is preferable to other brands. Why?  Well, one reason is the picture on the can.  Instead of just tomatoes, as other brands have, Contadina tomato paste features a pretty lady, and in the background, an Italian tomato grove.  It's buildings seem beautiful, and somewhat mysterious, as Italian buildings sometimes are.  If one is of a creative mind-set, looking at these buildings, (and the pretty lady), could, possibly, be the start of an interesting story to write...which might even become a best-seller and featured on Amazon!<br /><br />A more practical reason why (another type of) Contadina tomato sauce might be purchased is this:  Contadina ALSO makes, (in 6 ounce cans), an \"Italian Style\" tomato paste.  Though not the item featured here, it is certainly something to look for....hopefully, in the future on Amazon, and right now, in your local supermarket or warehouse store.  \"Italian Style\" Contadina tomato paste, in addition to mainly consisting of tomatoes, ALSO has a few spices and herbs.  These (to me), expertly chosen and blended herbs, add to the flavouring, and make for a tastier dish!<br /><br />As for the plain tomato paste being reviewed here, it's as good as any other brand -- plus you get that nice picture on the label.  It's not organic -- but it IS all-natural.  Just tomatoes.  The 12-ounce size means you don't have to open the can as often, you have plenty, (if you are preparing more than 2 servings at a time), and a 12-ounce can, because of it's size, will probably last longer on the shelf than a 6-ounce can, as smaller amounts of any food will spoil faster than larger amounts.<br /><br />Tomato PASTE -any brand -- is, I think, far more economical than tomato sauce.  Tomato sauce usually includes \"water\" as an ingredient, and most people can add that themselves!  Diluted, and with different ingredients added, tomato paste can become tomato soup, tomato juice...even tomato sauce!  If you don't want the bother of growing and/or canning your own tomatoes, just buying tomato PASTE at the store seems an economical, tasty, and very easy-to-prepare choice!<br /><br />\"Contadina Tomato Sauce -- New York's Best-Selling Brand.\"  I haven't heard that jingle in quite a while...so it might not be true any more.  Still, this is inexpensive, and quite delicious tomato paste.  Not organic...but all natural.  With that \"possibly imagination-engedering\" picture on the can, it is, I think, quite a good choice!\n",

      "I usually drink green tea, straight up.  But I wound up in a Starbucks one day and ordered a Chai Latte.  It didn't taste like tea to me at all!  It was more like hot chocolate, only with spices instead of chocolate.  I thought I'd gone to heaven.  I regretted not bringing some of the Tazo tea home later.  I just started craving the stuff.  I found Tazo Chai Spice at the supermarket, but wasn't happy with the price.<br /><br />So I thought I'd try Stash.  I already buy some of their green teas.  It's even better than Tazo!  The Spice Chai or Double Spice Chai, they're both delicious.  The Double just has more spices and works better with milk.  Or cream :)  Makes the house smell good, too.  Not knocking Tazo, either, after all, I did rave about their tea.  I just think this is even better.<br /><br />If you want to give tea as a gift, spice probably won't go to waste, no matter what the tea drinker usually drinks.  Every tea drinker I know can go for a spice every now and then.\n",

      "I travel a lot for business and I can never find decent peanut butter anywhere outside of the US. I toyed with the idea of bringing a small jar of peanut butter but it was heavy and there's always the probability of leakage. I was looking around Amazon one day and saw this. It got really good reviews so I tried it.  My fellow reviewers were absolutely right ... for dehydrated peanut butter, this tasted almost like the real thing. Now I'm not comparing it to Skippy of Jiffy because those peanut butters have a lot of salt and sugar in them. I buy the all natural peanut butter (no sugar or salt added) and when hydrated, this PB2 was almost as tasty as the hydrated all-natural version.<br /><br />It has instructions for the water to power ratio but I like to just mix to my preference. If I feel like a little creamier / smoother, then I add more water and vice versa. Obviously, it's more pricey than the peanut butter you would find at Costco or the supermarket but in addition to being light in weight, it's also 85% less fat than regular peanut butter.  I'm planning on packing several ziplocs of this yummy powder with my on my trips so I can have it on my bread for breakfast. The hotels always have jams and jellies but they never offer peanut butter. Now, I'm packing my own and loving it.\n",

      "Nature's Path wants to lead you to a better breakfast, but better than what?  If you eat fruit loops, than this is probably healthier.  If you eat oatmeal in the morning, then this is not a better bowl.<br /><br />Let's start with VALUE:<br />This is a primarily a puffed cereal with some flakes.  The side of the box says a serving is 2/3 cup, but since it is mostly just puffs I think 1 cup is a better serving size to provide closer to what one needs to make it a couple of hours without your stomach growling.  Dense cereals like granola or Grape-nuts are an ample breakfast in a 2/3 cup serving but this is not.  So following that logic you don't get 10 servings in a box, you get about 6-7 -- so figure 1 box will last a week.  So about 55 cents a meal, not too bad.<br /><br />NUTRITION:<br />There are 7 grams of sugar in a 2/3 cup serving, so almost 10 grams for a cup of cereal.  I was shocked that this cereal didn't have more vitamins, the only thing it had was 4% iron.  It doesn't have gluten, but this is a moot point if you don't suffer from a legitimate allergy or condition were gluten makes you sick.  Gluten-free is so trendy right now I feel like this product is hitting a lot of buzz words but not hitting the mark on nutrition.<br /><br />TASTE:<br />The second ingredient is sweetener, and you can really tell.  I was shocked it tasted so sweet for being touted as a healthy cereal.  To me it tastes like a vanilla flavored  kid's cereal.  It is a mix of large corn puffs, seed-sized puffs that I assume are flax and flakes.  The texture is nice and crunchy but it doesn't hew up the roof of your mouth.  It is not good to eat dry because of the teeny-tiny sedd puffs, they get everywhere.  This might be good used to spruce up other cereals, like add 1/3 cup of it to half a bowl of bran flakes or something.  Or you can feed it to your kid as a breakfast treat.  My toddler LOVED a bowl of this cereal, but I wouldn't give it to her every morning.<br /><br />OTHER:<br />This stuff worked great in some homemade granola bars I made.  I cut out 2/3 of the sweetener and added this cereal in hopes of making them less dense and it worked great.  Gave them a bit of a \"Rice Crispy Treat\" texture.<br /><br />OVERALL: This cereal gets 3 stars because it does have decent fiber (4) and protein (almost 3) for a cup of cold cereal that doesn't taste like twigs.  I would want it again to add to my granola bars.  It would be good for kids who want a \"sugar cereal\" fix, but remember to give them some fruit with it since this isn't sprayed with vitamins.  Not great, but not horrible.  I guess if this was marketed as a kids cereal with a silly cartoon bear on the box we'd all be amazed at how good for you it is compared to Captain Crunch.\n",

      "When I adopted my two female kitties two years ago, this dry food was recommended to me by their veterinarian and by a cat-loving friend.  The grain-free formula made perfect sense to me - why would I feed them corn?  My two girls LOVED it from the start and still do.  When they hear me filling their dishes, they come running in excitement, whether they're hungry or not.  This is their main food, but I also supplement this kibble with about a tablespoon each of canned/wet food morning and evening. . .the wet food is more like a \"treat\" and a \"ritual\" for these two pampered puffs.<br /><br />Anyway, my girls rarely if ever throw up, and their litter box is odor free (I use <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009X29WK\">Precious Cat Ultra Premium Clumping Cat Litter, 40 pound bag</a> that I buy locally much cheaper).  My kitties are strictly indoor kitties, but neither one is remotely overweight - they are happy, healthy, frisky and thriving on their TOTW diet.<br /><br />My friend's kitties didn't take to this \"cold turkey\" when she tried to switch them from another kibble, so she started mixing TOTW with the cheaper grain-filled brand in increasing quantities until they fully transitioned.  They eat TOTW exclusively now and love it, and she tells me they actually consume less food and are healthier and more active.\n",

I tried a ton of granolas from the grocery and it seems the taste lacks and the texture is always to hard or off putting. I put a handful or two on my Greek yogurt every morning and it makes a perfect healthy start to the day and cuts the sourness of the Yogurt.  Definitely the best granola I've tasted and I don't mind the price considering the quality of ingredients.  If you like peanut butter cookies, you better buy a couple bags because one won't last long. ;)\n",

This tea is from Seattle, Washington, and is very popular there.  We are from Syracuse, NY, and have not found any tea like this here. This tea doesn't have any preservatives, and has an absolutely amazing cinnamon flavor!  You can get this tea either regular or decaf.  We are hooked!

      "These bars (all of the roll types) are hard to eat. That's actually part of why I like them so much. Because they take some effort to bite into and chew, they basically force you to eat slower. As a result, you feel more satisfied at the end of eating one than if you had scarfed down a candy bar in three bites. I don't find them hard as rocks though, just very chewy. If you don't like chewy food, then these are definitely not for you. I also really like the texture contrast between the crunchy/crispy outside and the chewy nougat inside of the bar.<br /><br />There is a bit of a mess factor involved in eating these, as noted by one reviewer. The caramel is sticky and sometimes leaves traces on the wrapper, and the outside crispy/crunchy coating tends to crumble off a bit. If you want to keep the inside of your car spotlessly clean, you might not want to chow down on a Go-Lean roll bar while driving. Nevertheless, I still think these are some of the best bars out there. They are not discernibly chalky nor do they have a strange chemical aftertaste the way that many protein or energy bars do. They really are like fortified candy bars. And they pack quite a high protein and fiber punch for only 190 calories each, while only having about 13 mg of sugars--about 1 Tablespoon--per bar (I was expecting more like 25-30 mg when I tried my first one). The chocolate turtle roll is my favorite flavor, but honestly, I've tried every single flavor of the Go-Lean Roll bars, and they are really all quite good.\n",

I just transplanted the Juniper (in great shape) to the nice pot and am giving the tree some time to rest and adapt to it's new location before I start trimming and shaping it. I have a book my Son's bought me a few Christmas' ago which I'm looking at to get some ideas on this most important phase - how to make this young tree look like a weathered, stately old creature full of wisdom, and full of the care, perspective, and artistry of the Bonsai. This is a great purchase and I'm grateful to my wife for the gift. Now comes the hard part, to look into my deeper self and attempt what I know is far beyond me, to create a work of art I will cherish for years.

Scharffen Berger does not advertise its chocolate as \"Fair Trade\" chocolate, but has a policy of not buying beans from the west coast of Africa, where the industry is know to practice slavery and use child labor. Note: this chocolate is not labeled \"organic.\"<br /><br />This is a 41% cacao bar labeled as milk chocolate with sea salted almonds.  The bar has a nice, smooth, glossy appearance. The smell is of a French confiserie. Yes, just close your eyes and draw a deep breath. This scent reminds me of molded chocolate and chocolates wrapped in thin foil with fancy ribbon.<br /><br />The bar breaks with a nice snap, indicating that the chocolate has been well tempered. Small pieces of chopped, roasted and salted almonds are evenly scattered within the bar.<br /><br />The chocolate melts is creamy as it melts in your mouth. You taste caramel. It is sweet but not too sweet. The saltiness appears after the chocolate melts, leaving the almonds on your tongue. The combination is very tasty. The chocolate has a pleasant finish, not dark, not overly sweet, just right.<br /><br />The allure of this bar was so intense, it required finishing the entire bar. Need I say more?\n",

The pieces are small enough for her dainty little mouth and although there is no variety of flavors, she doesn't seem to care. Of course, a little chicken or cheese helps, too.

      "Im out working in the daytime and feel real bad that my energetic pup is home bored to death! So finding this toy calmed my fear of doggy daytime boredom. It has seven (my favorite number) treat chambers that challenged my dog to lift each cup in order to reveal its prize!<br /><br />It is a must have when teaching the basics of eating obedience/command. It also taught him important problem-solving skills. I had to turn the pieces upside down at first because my dog smelled the treat through the space but cried because he was too inexperienced to figure out how to get it. I suggest this technique if this puzzle is too challenging for your dog; at least till they figure out how to successfully pull the piece off when turned the right way.<br /><br />The Non-skid pads on bottom is an amazing feature. I guess the makers knew mischievous dogs would push the entire toy around as an additional part of the game lol. Its base material is plastic which is perfect for washing. My dog chooses to use his teeth to pull up the pieces not his paw, so slob is usually all over this toy. I'm so glad it's plastic!<br /><br />Its a must have because it provides hours of fun, and I encourage anyone with a curious doggy to get one!!!\n",

I wouldn't use a coffee maker that's been used for coffee, though, as the coffee effervescence will overpower the tea's flavor. My only gripe is I would like to see loose tea available in larger packages. Lipton used to sell it in one pound boxes, but now it's only available in 1/2 pound boxes. This six pack helps make up for the problem somewhat. We drink iced tea like some people drink their coffee: all the time! So loose tea works great for us (4 TBSP makes about a gallon) It's much easier than messing with a dozen or more tea bags per gallon. With the free shipping, the price per box is equal to or less than the purchase price in our local grocery stores and Wal*Mart stores, and that's with delivery to my front door!\n",

I'd literally just given away our Senseos because we can't get pods, only online and it's just too much to buy a case for just hubby to use.<br /><br />So, he had to improvise a little.  He tried boiling water and using it like a teabag.  That worked well.  He even ripped some open and used them in a regular coffeemaker with a filter - that worked well too.<br /><br />It had a good flavor and wasn't too acidic (I'd recently gotten him some Gevalia that he said was way too acidic for his taste, so this was a welcome change).  It wasn't too weak, nor too strong.  He compared it to Dunkin Donuts' coffee, saying it was just as good as Dunkin (and that was saying a lot for him).<br /><br />I'm hoping to find Marley's coffee in a regular grind now for him.

I use plain table sugar when I'm making a litre of my favorite tisane iced tea. I give 5 star to table sugar too, LOL!<br /><br />And yeah, the jar that Teavana suggest you put your German rock sugar in is pretty nice, anyone who has complaints about it is not right in the head. I didn't regret my purchases, and even though this store's items are pretty much expensive, I would still buy from them. Shipping's free on $50 up (doesn't take much to reach this total), ships fast too even if it's just standard shipping. Items are packaged well, lots of paper & bubble wrap. And the quality & design of the products are excellent, reflects the reason why they're expensive.<br /><br />But if you really think about it, expensive products that you use well are a bargain.

      "we are from rice eating regions of India with a special liking to basmati. We were so excited to find Tilda on Amazon and have been buying the 10 Lb bags every month ( yes thats how much we like it).. It is the finest quality long grain very aromatic and delicious. People from the Indian subcontinent prefer non-sticky long grain rice that comes out as fluffy but single grained in texture once cooked unlike the rest of asia where sticky rice is the norm. The amount of starch is what determines the stickyness. In case of basmati the finest are ones that are very long grained and not at all sticky. Must soak basmati in water for atleast 15 mins before cooking. we use the rice cooker and Tilda comes out perfectly. Biryani , Pilaf and simple plain rice all come out delectably with this. Tilda is definitely considered on of the finest basmati's back home in India and is most often the preferred rice at restaurants and for special occasions at home. At the price Amazon is making this available we have it everyday !\n",

      "I was diagnosed with type 2 six months back. Decided to lose weight and cut carbs (no sugar, potato, pasta, rice or bread 95% of the time, sometimes I cheat :) ) in order to get in control. Been using extend bars since. I have one for breakfast with coffee. Then for lunch I have another one, sometimes I have a salad instead, or with. The key is that they really seem to work well to suppress my appetite, probably because they stabilize my blood sugar. Anyway after six months I'm down 25 Ibs without really starving and my blood sugar level have improved significantly, my doctor was very happy and told me I will not need any Meds if I keep this up.<br />I plan to lose another 25 with the help of the extend bars.<br />So I recommend these. Just note that some bars have more sugar. I only use the ones without.<br />Note that I also do a bunch of other stuff nutritionally to lose weight and control blood sugar so this is one piece of the puzzle, but a big one.<br />One thing I have NOT done is exercise. Not one bit. Not proud of it but happy that I can lose weight and improve blood sugar levels anyway. No doubt I would do even better with exercise.\n",

      "First there were two cases of IZZE: one each of Apple and Pomegranate.  I quickly cleaned out half of my refrigerator to make room for the 48 cans of IZZE.  Then a case of IZZE Clementine arrived. Finally, I received the sought-after Blackberry. The IZZEs were multiplying out of control.  The two new ones took up the rest of my refrigerator. There was no room for anything but IZZE. At my house, it has become all IZZE all the time.<br /><br />To the credit of IZZE, the ingredients of all their products are posted on the IZZE web site. The IZZEs have all natural ingredients, although the labeling indicates that the citrus varieties. e.g. Clementine and Grapefruit, contain Gum Arabic and Ester Gum. According to sources on the web, Gum Arabic is a purified natural vegetable gum obtained from the acacia tree that is used as a stabilizer/emulsifier.  Ester Gum is purified natural rosin from pine trees.  I suppose trees are natural.<br /><br />An interesting fact about the IZZEs is that for every type of IZZE, the fruit named on the front of the can does not correspond to the first-listed ingredient. Here is the IZZE code decoded: for Apple the main ingredient is White Grape, for Pomegranate it is Apple, for Clementine it is White Grape, for Grapefruit it is White Grape and for Blackberry it is White Grape.<br /><br />There is no caffeine in IZZE. The IZZE web site says that IZZE employees ride bikes to the local coffee shop. So you cannot live on IZZE alone! All of the IZZEs are fortified with vitamins, e.g., Vitamin B6, C, and Niacin. I am sure that the IZZE people anticipated the need for vitamins for people surviving on a diet consisting of IZZE and coffee.<br /><br />All of the IZZE flavors have their own character.  Some are weaker, others stronger.  In order of weak to strong for the four that I tried, I would arrange them as Apple, Clementine, Blackberry, and Pomegranate.  I prefer the more subtle flavors of Apple and Clementine. However, when I brought an assortment to a gathering of friends, all of the Pomegranate cans disappeared while the Apples remained untouched.  It is a matter of personal taste. People who are used to soda, which includes most people,  prefer the stronger Blackberry and Pomegranate. Juice people may like Apple or Clementine better. I give the Clementine 5 stars, the others 4 stars. All of the flavors are good. Which one you prefer is up to you.\n",

Um, no they are not.  If you want less - don't fill the cup all the way.  Crazy how that works!  I fill the cups to the top, and my son eats almost the entire serving.  I am glad that the cups are as big as they are.<br /><br />Clean up is a breeze - we don't put it in the dishwasher, we just run it under hot water.<br /><br />To prepare the frozen cubes, I pop them in the microwave for 15 seconds - then stir.

It is &quot;gourmet-priced&quot; candy, but still a reasonably priced treat that's well worth it. It is far, far better than the crud that's passed off as black licorice in this country! (no wonder so many people say they dislike it!)<p>Kookaburra Black Licorice is the real, old-fashioned licorice deal, in HUGE pieces that are perfect for a mid-day licorice fix.<br />Buy a bag for your fellow licorice lovers, or invite a supposed black-licorice hater to try the real deal--they just might change their minds...This would also make a great, inexpensive just-for-the-heck-of-it gift for an elderly person who fondly remembers the taste of REAL licorice.<p>Oh yeah, one little word of warning though: Real licorice can have a mild laxative effect in some people. :)\n",

      "I bought a few bags of these to use with my Sephra chocolate fountain for my husband's birthday party. Amazon had a buy 3, get 1 free deal which was great. The chocolate melted very easily and the instructions are super easy to follow, which I was thankful for amidst the hectic party prep going on around me. Best of all, the chocolate tasted delicious!! I was going to throw out the leftover chocolate but my husband and kids begged me to save it. I put the remaining chocolate into a covered, shallow tupperware container overnight and the next day broke the chocolate into big chuncks. They munched on chocolate pieces when they had a sweet tooth until it was all gone (didn't take long). Very convenient and tastes delicious!\n",

Whole grains, maple syrup, pecans...yum. Got a pack of 6 and it was gone in two weeks. Don't hesitate to buy for children, the kids I babysit couldn't get enough of it. Their mom now buys it.<br /><br />I like that I can read/recognize all of the ingredients:<br /><br />Organic whole wheat meal, organic rolled oats, organic evaporated cane juice, organic wheat bran, organic pecans, organic flax, organic soy oil, organic brown rice flour, organic oat bran, organic barley malt extract, sea salt, organic maple syrup, organic coconut, natural maple flavor, organic oat syrup solids, organic molasses, organic cinnamon.<br /><br />Each serving has 220 calories and 5g of daily fiber (which is 20 percent of your total). I've been trying to find a cereal with a lot of fiber that tastes good. I find most don't taste very good. According to WebMD, most Americans only get 14g of fiber. I usually have two servings of this cereal for breakfast, so I'm halfway to my allotment of daily fiber.<br /><br />My nutritionist at Carolina advised me a diet high in whole grains and fiber leads to less weight over the years. Maybe this cereal doesn't help you lose weight, but it certainly doesn't put it on. These aren't empty calories, this cereal is filling and nutritious.\n",

      "Butter finger candy bars are a time honored classic. Other than snickers, there is no better tasting candy bar IMO. You really can't go wrong whenever you order your favorite candy via Amazon. The main reason people buy foodstuff like this on the web is to buy in bulk and perhaps save yourself a little money. You can also save on gas because buying like this keeps you from making repeated, short trips to the local, around the corner convenience store in search of your favorite candy bar. Amazon is always good and I did save a few bucks by buying two cartons. I actually purchased these for my mother and not myself so she should have enough to last her for awhile.<br /><br />The biggest disappointment I had with this is the seller took too long to get the item to me via FedEX. They should have shipped USPS. Only use FedEX and UPS for expedited shipping. If you wanna keep the shipping charges down to a min. and get the item AQAP, always ship USPS.\n",

When we started giving her pills, we tried cheese, peanut butter, meat, etc... but I worried about the extra calories. Our vet recommended pill pockets and we LOVE them! She thinks it's a treat - so no medicine battles - and it is the perfect consistency so that the pills don't fall out and she can't just lick it off (like peanut butter). I use the twice-a-day medicine time as training time since these are treats to her! :-) It is super easy and we use the larger size and divide them in half for her smaller pills so the bag lasts longer. The price on Amazon (as long as I have free shipping) is GREAT and better than most pet stores. Because I can use a small portion of the pill pocket and it holds/hides the pill and she takes it greedily - I don't worry she's getting too many extra calories AND I KNOW she's getting her medicine!

      "Now the thought of a sweet potato chip might not initially appeal to everyone but I gave these a try and I am glad I did.  They are the right mix of sweet and salty so all those cravings get satisfied in one bite.  They are light and crispy.  If you have ever had a Muncho chip, they are similar in texture to those but not so salty like a Muncho.  You really don't get a strong sweet potato flavor and I at two small bags in one setting with ease.  They are low fat, low calorie (100 calories per bag which is a serving).  They contain natural ingredients like sunflower and safflower oil, sea salt, and organic yellow corn flour.  They are very very good.\n",

I work full time and go to school at night, and I have PCOS, so there are occasions when my energy gets really sluggish.  I'm thrilled to have these to rely on when it's absolutely necessary.  I definitely don't intend to get in the habit of using them, as I know anything like this isn't really healthy, but they're a lifesaver when really needed.

It is easy to put a scoop of powder with milk, soy milk, rice milk (Rice Dream) or juice and blend it into a nutritious shake.<br /><br />Frankly, if I had to choose between a milk shake and a Soy Protein shake, I'd choose GeniSoy. Not only because I have seen the great results of taking soy powder, but also because I just feel healthier and this product is not overly sweet. It is just perfect.<br /><br />You can mix up this shake after a workout or drink it as a breakfast shake. Basically, you can drink this at any time of the day and feel good about this Fat-Free and Cholesterol-free product.<br /><br />Ingredients: IP Isolated Soy Protein, fructose, maltodextrin, guar gum, natural flavor, canola oil, cellulose gum and a Vitamin and Mineral mixture that contains: Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Calcium, Iron, Vitamin E, Thiamine, Riboflavin, Niacin, Vitamin B-6, Folate, Vitamin B-12, Biotin, Pantothenic Acid, Phosphorus, Iodine, Magnesium, Zinc, Selenium and Copper.<br /><br />For the best results, blend this in a shaker or use an electric blender.<br /><br />For some reason, this product is especially good when you are eating a Chocolate Brownie Clif Bar. The two products are just delicious together. I've also been adding a scoop of All One's Antioxidant Vitamin Powder to the blend.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review\n",

(About half of them do.)<br /><br />The ones who can take Sen-Sen usually become fans (or at least, they'll ask me for some every time they see me.)  That's why I buy a dozen packs at a time.  Not only is it tough finding it locally, but with a dozen packs, I have stocking stuffers for all those friends who ask for mine.\n",

      "Obviously a lot of people like this bar, myself included, so I thought I'd review it a bit differently.  When I was searching for a healthier between meal afternoon snack I read a lot of reviews for a lot of products.  I wanted something with few ingredients, not \"fortified\" and with some nuts in it.  I settled on these Larabar Fruit & Nut Cherry Pie bars and the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P504ZG\">Pure Bar Organic Wild Blueberry Living Food Bar</a>.  I love cherries and I love blueberries so they seemed like good choices.<br /><br />The stats of the bars are very similar, weight (both 1.7oz, not 1.8), calories, fat, sugars, etc.  The PURE has more protein at 6g vs 4g.  The Larabar has no sodium while the PURE has just a bit at 5mg.  The Larabar is thicker, the PURE bar is wider.  Visually the Larabar appears to have more nuts in it, which doesn't seem to jive with the protein stats.  The PURE bar has a grittier texture while chewing so maybe more of the nuts are finely ground.<br /><br />1st ingredient is dates for both followed by almonds and then cherries for the Larabar and followed by blueberries and various nuts, organic agave nectar, rice protein and lemon juice for the PURE bar.  One would think with the extra ingredients in the PURE bar they were added to tweak the flavor or give it a fresher taste, but the flavor of the Larabar is better than the PURE by a pretty good margin.  It has a much fresher and lively taste.  I have to say the PURE bar is a bit cardboardy tasting to me and has a drier mouth feel.  It is not bad, in fact my 2 youngest kids eat them readily, just not nearly as good as the Larabar.  I think the tartness of the cherries in the Larabar kick up the flavor vs the milder blueberry flavor of the PURE (maybe the lemon juice add as an attempt to kick up the PURE bar flavor and tartness?).  In fairness I should probably review the PURE Cherry Cashew bar but I much prefer almonds over cashews so don't plan on ordering any from Amazon.  If I stumble on the PURE cherry in a regular store I will give one a try thugh.  I still get both auto shipped from Amazon for variety sake, but am looking for a better tasting blueberry bar w/ basic ingredients including nuts.<br /><br />For grins here is a comparison of the Larabar, PURE, Snickers, Hershey's and Maruchan Chicken Ramen noodles in a few categories.  Stats are listed in the order I listed them in the previous sentence.<br /><br />Calories:  190, 190, 280, 210, 380<br />Total Fat:  8g, 9, 14, 13, 14  Saturated Fat:  0.5g, 1, 5, 8, 7<br />Sugars:  21g, 20, 30, 24, 0<br />Protein:  4g, 6, 4, 3, 10<br />Sodium:  0mg, 5, 140, 35, 1540 !!!\n",

I will not complain when someone comes out with an ingenious product that has barely any calories per serving, tastes pretty amazing, and curbs the sweet tooth craving. After a little experimenting, I also figured out that (since this product is rock hard) if you microwave it for about 15 seconds, it can become pretty creamy instead of like eating ice (which some have complained about). The consistency becomes a little closer to the \"real deal\" - like ice cream.

      "NEW<br />Updated 1-6-2012Yes I to received a shipment from Amazon on this tea and had the same problem stating no artificial flavors and then the new box says on the front natural and artificial flavors. I called Amazon and they refunded me and were suppose to correct this. Still they have not. The company still makes this tea as before with no artificial flavors, caffiene free although a new box. If they would call the company as I did then Amazon is selling the wrong box listed and pictured. I have called Amazon who said they would fix this but has not. Amazon needs to correct this problem.<br /><br />BEFORE<br />Wow if you love a good tea that is flavorful and sweet. This is the tea to enjoy. Went on vacation and happened to find this tea that has no caffeine. Tried it and a real pleasure to drink. I do have mine with soy milk. Its like having a latte. I was glad to find another tea that I can enjoy for years to come and to find this at Amazon was a plus!\n",

You can tell that there is no oil in the product so it is a little less creamy than real peanut butter. I LOVE peanut butter, but was doing weight watchers and couldnt justify using my points for real peanut butter. With PB2 I could eat peanut butter all the time and not feel guilty! It gets a little creamier when used with warm toast or on an English Muffin.<br /><br />I brough PB2 to work one day and introduced it to my co-workers. They asked to buy the jar I had left! They then ordered SIX jars for themselves. If you dont mind the calories, you might want to stick to regular peanut butter. But if you want an alternative that tastes just like peanut butter without the oil... this is EXCELLANT. I now actually prefer this to real peanut butter!!\n",

I can also see this becoming a nice breakfast food with the addition of a sweetener of choice and perhaps some banana. Glad I tried it based on the great reviews! If you've never tried Couscous, it is SO easy to make! In fact, I just heat some water in a Pyrex measuring cup in the microwave. It gets to a boil between 2-3 minutes. Pour the dry couscous in a bowl (I've even used a coated paper bowl at work, so I can toss it afterward!) and just pour the hot water over it. Then just cover the bowl with a plate (paper or regular) and just let it sit for a few minutes. The water absorbs, just fluff with a fork, easy, done!<br /><br />**A comment about the 1-star review posted above mine: Please notice that customer is in Prague. These concerns reported may be only happening with international orders. Not that it should happen anywhere, but there are more potential problems when food is shipped out of the country. Amazon has warehouses all over, and also deals with vendors who sell through Amazon. I've never had any issues with mold or Weevils from Hodgson Mills or other food brands sold by Amazon. I have had issues with damaged shipments, but Amazon immediately replaced the order. I don't know the policy outside of the USA, but if you order an Amazon stocked item (not a vendor selling on Amazon), in my experience here in the USA, Amazon will always stand behind the product and replace at no charge or refund in full.\n",

I'm buying more of this today and having a bottle a day!<br /><br />When you drink the water, the words \"WELCOME TO THE DARK SIDE OF WATER\" appear on the bottle (the words are black so you can't see it when it's still full).

Just as another reviewer said, Yogi Tea's Breathe Deep is phenomenally effective for asthma!<br />I recently moved into a rented house where a cat lived for 7 years; I have cat asthma, and have struggled to regain my normal breathing. I still use my Albuterol inhaler when necessary, and check in with my doctor (read: I'd still recommend traditional medicine), but nothing has worked as well as this tea!

Overall, it adds a bit of creaminess to the taco and had a very nice taste.  It is not hot for a jalapeno sauce.  I ended up making nachos the next day with some of the leftover taco beef I had and added the sauce to the mix before I cooked them.  I did not like the way they came out.  This sauce is definitely better as an add on rather than something to cook with.<br /><br />It's an Ok sauce (hence my star rating) but I won't be using this as my regular taco sauce as I still prefer the red typical sauce I had been using.  This will be used to change things up a bit when I am tired of eating my usual taco.

There is a very slight aftertaste, but nothing as bad as the artificially sweetened stuff.  It dissolves very quickly, and is a nice change from plain water.  I am most fond of the grape, which is odd, as I don't generally go for grape flavored drinks of other types.  The lemonade is also good.

I currently have three or so bags stored in my pantry.  I keep them on hand, as I cannot have gluten, dairy or soy, and these are an allergen free kitchen basic.  I just open the bag over a large container and slide the noodles into it, then run very hot tap water to cover them and let set for about ten minutes.  Then I take my kitchen shears and cut them into smaller lengths.  When ready to add or use them, I drain off as much of the water as I can without losing the noodles, then lift them by hand into the soup or into a serving bowl.  When I get near the end, I drain off the rest of the water and then pour them into the soup or lift them into the bowl.  If I have leftovers, I store them, covered, in the refrig.

When it arrived two boxes were opened, and I mean this was not rough play by UPS, the boxes were literally opened and about one quarter of the contents were gone in each box. It took us a while to undue all the boxes after finding the first one and this was so deliberately done. Each box was seperately wrapped, and the reason I ordered this type of box was because the quantity is supposed ot be greater for the same price as other brands. Someone truly is literally stealing Kitty Litter out of boxes, then shipping the rest in orders. They were open at the perforations on the side of the box, the way you normally open Kitty litter boxes, not from mishandling.

      "Wow.  These are unlike any snack/health bar I've ever had.  Cocoa Mole' is such a great flavor- nice and chocolatey with a kick of chili pepper- works great as a mid-morning snack!  I like almost all the other Larabar flavors- except the banana which is kind of bland.  Can hardly wait to try the Key Lime Pie and the Pistachio flavors.  I wish these bars were sold in regular grocery stores, it's a long drive to Wild Oats from where I live...\n",

      "One tbsp of Wholesome organic molasses offers me 20% iron, 18% calcium which is more in compare to milk for every calorie, 15% potassium, 11% magnesium, and 10% copper. With 50 calories and 11gr sugar, I only use one tbsp a day in my green tea daily as well as when I am in need of fast energy, without any additives, right exactly before any sports like weight lifting, mountain biking, surfing, etc. if I have no access to banana or grapefruit. Potassium stops cramps and this is my life saver.. This is a necessity just like I consume honey, Bragg's apple cider, organic flax-sesame seeds, etc. as super food. Once opened, I place some in a smaller tightly sealed container and keep it in refrigerator, refill as needed, but consume it within 6 months. I am into sports, diet and nutrition and blackstrap molasses' nutritional value varies depending on the quality of the sugar cane or beets from which it was extracted. For that reason organic and brand is extremely important to me. Honey looses its medicinal value when added to tea but since molasses is a by product which was heated during the production, further heat does not impact the nutritional value. With all that said, you will still need to get used to the taste since the taste is somewhere around bitter, beet juice and changes the taste of the tea. Bravo.\n",

      "I was raised in a house that always had at least one cat being fed Meow Mix. Owning my own cat now, I've done some research on available food choices. Meow Mix is one of the cheapest--and one of the worst.<br /><br />Not quite like humans, cats will eat until they are nutritionally satisfied *or* full. The problem with cheap brand cat foods is that they use synthetic products, carbohydrate-based fillers, and processed meat by-products. Cats are obligate carnivores. The first two ingredients on Meow Mix's list (the ones used in most abundance in the product) are corn. As a result, cats are getting fewer needed nutrients per serving, causing them to eat until they get full and to eat more over the course of the day.<br /><br />Healthy food results in a healthier cat. Weight control, shedding, disease development, and more are all influenced by a cat's food. The excessive use of carbohydrate-based fillers in cheap cat foods, as part of this reality, can lead to weight gain and a higher risk of diabetes.<br /><br />Brands sold in quality pet stores start with Iambs as the \"baseline,\" and even Iambs isn't what I'd call good for your cat. Many of my local shelters feed their cats Iambs as the least expensive acceptable cat food. Even better, companies such as Orijen and EVO make premium cat foods made with very little or no grain content, which are ingredients cats would not naturally eat. Whatever you decide, check the ingredients list. Make sure some kind of meat is listed as the primary ingredient with other meats as close to the top of the list as possible. Also make sure those are actual meats. Meats are better then meat meals, and meat meals are ok (and usually unavoidable). Meat by-products are what you want to watch out for.<br /><br />The reality is that your cat is not biologically designed to eat a diet consisting mostly of corn or grain. Healthy cat food is more expensive, but your cat will eat less of it, helping to mitigate the cost a bit. I recommend premium cat foods for this reason. They're better for your cat in every conceivable way, and they won't break your bank. Even if you are on a budget, consider the cost medical concerns due to obesity or diabetes could incur. If you are currently using this food, maybe it's time to switch.\n",

      "I love these bags. I have both long and short handle ones from this seller. They are very well made. I will be ordering long handled ones next as I only have one long handled one now. I am so glad I ordered these as they are all cotton and you cannot see through the bottom of them like the ones the stores sell.<br /><br />There is a little hook on both sides of the bag for the rack in the grocery store. You do not have to turn the bag around and make sure you hook the right side because there is one on both sides. Very handy. The size is the same size as a paper bag, which is just right. I would not want to carry a large bag, but I am an older person and she does have large bags for those would would want to fill up a large one.<br /><br />They are not too heavy of canvas, and I think it is just right because you do not notice the bag weight when it is full. The handles are so convienent and comfortable to carry your groceries in.<br /><br />Now if I can remember every time to bring them in the store with me, I'll have it made :-)  I am still new with these bags. The other day I forgot and when I was checking out, I realized I was on a meat buying run, so maybe it was a good thing to forget the bags. I was thinking at the check out that the meat would leak in the bags.<br /><br />The seller is so easy to work with and shipped very fast too. All around these are well made bags of the right weight and functionality.\n",

      "Some people say these are a high fat , high calorie , high glycemic , glorified candybar. I say otherwise. Concerning fat, not all fats are equal , some being healthy . Since this bar is raw all of the fat,protein and sugar have not been denatured  which means you get the full health benefit. As far as being high calorie , considering how nutrient dense these babies are I don't consider 200 calories high in calories at all. For me 200 calories is a perfect number allowing it to be used an nutrient dense snack or a quick meal on the go.<br /><br />Concerning these supposedly being high glycemic , sure , if you were to eat the dates in these by themselves it would be , but the nuts in them bring the glycemic load of the entire bar way down , which is another benefit of the healthy fats in these bars , it allows for the sugars to be released slower and for it to digest slower making you feel full and satisfied longer.<br /><br />As far as these not being any better than a candybar I say noway! No preservatives, no high fructose corn syrup , etc, in these babies , just a healthy combo of fruit and nuts. How many nutrients does a candybar have ? Now look at the nutrient in these , loaded with minerals . Also, unlike many other foods these aren't naturally low in nutrients and then \"fortified\" with man made vitamins and minerals to make them then appear healthy. All the nutrients in these are naturally occuring which gives you the benefits in a synergistic way where other healthy compounds such as flavonoids and phenols work together with naturally occurring vitamins and minerals.<br /><br />People need to let go of the old dogma which makes them think all fat is bad but if it's sugar free then it MUST be good. If that were true then cotton candy , pepsi and skittles would all be great for ya !Fruit and nuts makes for a good healthy breakfast or snack. I'll eat my greens/green smoothies in the other meals of the day. A person shouldn't eat only fruit and nuts during the day but they shouldn't only eat greens either . These bars help make it easy to strike a balance in your diet on the go. Larabars, Pure bars , SmartMonkey bars and ThinkOrganic bars are all healthy brands of raw bars that amazon sells and all worth a try . Experiment and see what flavors you like best , or make your own !\n",

I have been feeding this food to my cats since the recall horror of 2007 and prior to the change it was excellent food and I was thrilled with it. Since ZiwiPeak has been switched to canning in the US it has been a nightmare. Several times in the last year I have opened the food to find it is a green or blue colour. I had to return those cans because it made both my cats vomit and have loose stools. Also recently I have found large sharp bone pieces are present and very large strange chunks of greyish pink material that looks like connective tissue. I've contacted the US distributor twice but they have never replied. A batch I got this month with an expiry date of 2014 has caused severe vomiting and shedding with both cats who were previously healthy.\n",

And they were healthy and good for their teeth and gums.<br />But having received a recent re-order, I am now editing my own review and downgrading from five stars to one. THEY HAVE CHANGED THESE TREATS. They are NOT WRAPPED IN CHICKEN anymore. They have some kind of PAINT on them instead of chicken. It doesn't even smell like chicken. This is so disappointing. If you are re-ordering these thinking you'll get the old wonderful Chewritos - you won't. Change is significant enough that I recommend NOT ORDERING. It's misleading labeling.

      "The Green Energy Tea Fusion tea powder allows you to make instant ice green tea wherever you happen to be. All it takes is to fill a bottle with a few ounces of cold water and shake. The end product is a green tea that's honey-lemony tasting, low-calorie and, the maker claims, is made of mostly organic ingredients.<br /><br />Each packet has enough powder to make an okay-tasting 8-16 oz. amount of cool green tea. All you need to do is start with a bottle of cold water, take a sip or 2 to make some room for the shaking that's to follow, drop the powder in, then shake the bottle and... here's your cool green tea. It tastes the way you would expect iced green tea to taste when spiked with a little bit of lemon and honey. The taste, when 16 oz. of water are used is comparable to the gallon-size 'green diet ice tea' containers you could buy from some grocery stores only a little more diluted. When used with only 8 oz. it begins to taste like serious tea but than you'd want a second packet. The powder tea packets give you the ability to make instant green ice tea wherever you are and whenever you feel like without having to carry along a gallon-size canister. In addition, the makers claim that the caffeine and the EGCG (100mg) from one packet are sufficient to 'boost' your metabolism if taken three times daily.<br /><br />As far as contents, the main ingredients listed are: organic Japanese green tea extract, organic Yerba Mat&eacute; extract, organic Guava seeds extract, organic Aloe Vera extract, organic honey crystals and some others.<br /><br />The powder has 23 calories but none of them came from saturated fats or trans fats and none of the sweet taste comes from sugar because no sugar was added.<br /><br />I enjoy drinking this when no better options are available - such as the ability to make 'real' brewed green or, better, white tea. I do not see it as a regular substitute to 'real' tea. Since the product does meet my expectations - produce a reasonably decent drink when nothing better can be had, it gets it's 5 stars and my endorsement (for emergencies only) because I can't think of much that could be done to make it better.<br /><br />__________________________________<br /><br />Note:<br /><br />EGCG also known as Epigallocatechin 3-gallate is a powerful anti-oxidant that can be found in green tea but not in black tea.\n",

Today on Amazon I now see <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F3N7AC\">Splenda No Calorie Sweetener 1000 Individual Packets Value Pack (Net Wt. 2.2</a> for as low as $22.89. But the less-than-sweet moral of this story is that things may not *always* cost less on the web.\n",

      "I have been involved in dog rescue for many years. I recently took in a very large hound who had been starved within an inch of his life. The vet recommended this (in addition to many other treatments and holistic measures, including yogurt!) to try to quickly get some weight on and good nutrition into the dog. You'd think a starving dog would eat anything, but often times they will not. I had to bake this hound homemade meatloaf for a month. Wellness and Nutro canned were the only \"dog foods\" I could get him to eat. But he did gain weight steadily, was able to wean off 'human food', and did very well.  After gaining 20 lbs, he was adopted by a wonderful family. When you need the best, any of the Wellness Brands I would highly recommend.\n",

      "I just received this tea after waiting only 2 days, that is amazing.<br />I could not wait to try it so I followed the other reviewers' advice and washed it first. Etc. Etc.<br />Now I am not saying anyone is wrong by any means but I tried it both ways, washing and not washing and I cannot tell the difference.<br />To me I believe it is a waste of tea to wash it, in fact I found a lovely video that may be very interesting to some of you it is only 5 minutes this man is Dr. Tea he has written a book and has a shop and sells teas. He is basically an expert and he does not wash his tea.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />I did however make a nice ritual out of the making of the tea.  I had the opportunity to purchase an authentic tea pot along with all the extras that I found is needed to make a good tea, I got it from China Town in California, and I used it the proper way for the first time today, it was relaxing and fun.<br /><br />I was not aware of all the health properties in this particular tea, the list is impressive, heart problems, high blood pressure, cholesterol, it helps with teeth and gum problems and promotes its healing, it is also a weight reduction tea, but what I needed it for is the Theanine that is in this tea, I have an autoimmune disease that causes inner tremors and I take L-theanine to calm me down but this tea is doing that in a more natural way.  I will no longer be needing to purchase this supplement. This also is a tea that has very little caffeine and it did not make me nervous like the average teas do.<br />I do recommend this tea to everyone especially if you have any of these problems, but for me I enjoyed a very restful day without any jitters.<br /><br />As for the cost, this morning I cut off 2 grams of the tea and I am just finishing it, you can brew this tea many many times as you can see in the video, this makes it, for me, a very inexpensive tea. It will last forever even if I use it on a daily basis which I now intend to do.\n",

      "As a college student who lives in the dormitory, I often get bored of the food that school provides. They always have same menus and it does not taste good. Also, as a Korean student, hamburgers, pasta, and bread are too greasy and cheesy for me. Thus, when I do not feel like going down to the school cafeteria or want to eat Korean food, I cook Shin ramen. It is not cheesy or greasy like burgers, and eating Shin ramen makes me feel I am home.<br />On the front wrap of the ramen, it has picture of cooked Shin ramen with Red coloring which indicates it is hot and spicy. On the back of the wrap, it has recipe, ingredients, expiration date, and etc. By just looking at the wrap, my mouth gets watery and I get hungry. I can imagine the taste and its spiciness while I am writing this review.<br />For those people who are not good at cooking foods, you do not have to worry. Cooking this ramen is very simple and it can be cooked in less than five minutes. Basic way to cook this ramen is to follow the direction on the back of the wrapper. First, boil the water and put noodle and two packs of seasonings. Anybody can cook this. If this direction is still hard for you, you can get Shin ramen cup-noodle. You just need to pour boiling water in to the cup.<br />Other than simple recipe, there are many different ways to cook this ramen. The spiciness of the ramen can be controlled by putting how much seasoning is put. Also, adding different ingredients, such as mushrooms, hot peppers, meats, or eggs can make the soup taste much better. My recommendation is putting all the seasoning and adding Kimchi to make the ramen spicier. For those people who are not so good at eating spicy food, I recommend putting raw egg to make the soup less spicy.<br />Also, I recommend try eating Shin ramen raw. Crack the noodles before you open the wrapper. Open up the wrapper, do not put the vegetable seasoning, but put spicy seasoning. After, you shake them up together and make spicy ramen chip. Instead of eating as a meal, you can enjoy it as a snack while you watch movie or TV.<br /> As a ramen lover, I have tried many different ramen from different countries. After I have tasted most of the ramen, I made a conclusion that Shin ramen shows superior quantity and quality from the other types of ramen. Compared to the most common ramen in the United States, the Maruchan ramen, Shin ramen has more filling and spicy. Other than its better quantity, its quality is also superior. Shin ramen has two seasonings, which includes dried vegetable seasonings and spicy seasonings. However, Maruchan ramen do not have vegetable seasoning.<br />Although it shows superior quantity and quality from Maruchan ramen, it is quite expensive compared to Maruchan ramen. It is fifteen dollars per pack of 20 ramen, when Maruchan ramen is fifteen dollars per pack of thirty six ramen. Although the price is higher than Maruchan, I strongly recommend Shin ramen for those who want spicy hot soup with better filling.\n",

      "I've always liked Knorr products and this is no exception. The boullion dissolves effortlessly in liquid and the flavor is wonderful. There are a lot of different ways to use boullion as a flavoring agent and I'm not shy about experimenting. It was fortunate, however, that I took a closer look at the ingredients list on the label -- the fourth item on the list is monosodium glutamate! I have no problem with MSG myself but I have friends who suffer different degrees of allergic reaction to it, one in particular who becomes very ill.<br /><br />I'll have to be very careful when and if I use this boullion when I'm having company for meals. Had I known of the MSG content, I wouldn't have made the purchase, much as I like the product otherwise. Given the publicity about MSG sensitivity, I feel Knorr should have shown a clear warning at the point of sale at Amazon. One can't read ingredient labels online, more's the pity. That's why I knocked a star off the score.<br /><br />So count this as a warning: if you or those you'll be feeding can't handle MSG, don't buy this boullion. Otherwise, it's really good.\n",

      "I bought a medium automatic pet door in October 2011. Very happy with the door and my dogs quickly took to it. I paid $330 for the door + another $200 on collars and replacement collars. My door did malfunction about 2 months after the 1 year warranty (of course). I was originally very frustrated for a few reasons. First, I spent so much money on their product and couldn't believe it went out so soon ... and second, I was frustrated with the initial customer service person on the phone. They have an amazing follow up team that I spoke to a few days after I called about my broken door ... they were extremely helpful and they stand behind their claim of \"engineered to last a lifetime\". Perhaps I just got the 1 door that went out too soon?? Only time will tell. However, they have sent me a replacement door with an extended warranty. This really proves to me that they stand behind their product. It really makes me feel good about their product AND the fact that I have spent so much on their product. I knocked out 1 star only because these doors and collars are super expensive. A downfall ... however you get an awesome door that you can't find anywhere out there!<br /><br />A note on their waterproof collars ... not really waterproof so I wouldn't spend the extra money on them. Mine have gone out with just a simple drizzle outside. Instead I recommend the regular collars and buying a few back ups.\n",

      "This is a pretty good gluten-free bread, but in my family's view, not as super delicious as Pamela's.  I like this bread for a basic sandwich bread--it has a decent texture and no strong or off flavors.  And rises to a nice size.  However, I found it to be much dryer than Pamela's GF bread mix.  I'm not sure what the solution to the dryness is--I'm going to try the strategies other reviewers recommended about putting olive oil on the top or adding applesauce to the mix.  (Note, though, that even though I say this loaf is somewhat dry, that's in comparison to Pamela's; Namaste is far moister than the typical Bread For Life, Kinnikinnick premade breads.  So it's a huge improvement over those and worth making just for that reason).  Note that it is also much less sweet than Pamela's bread, which my children eat like candy when I cut it open warm.  Thus, it may be better for people who have diabetic concerns (I'm just guessing, but Pamela's bread is VERY sweet).  Note that I've tested both breads only by using a bread maker.  The breads worked beautifully that way.\n",

      "This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.\n",

      "When I ordered this food, I was expecting to wait longer than usual for it to arrive, but it came in less than one week.  I was also worried that my 2 cats, especially the older 7 year old, would not eat it, because since Petco stopped stocking Innova pouches, their favorite food before the pet food scare in early 2007, I've had some problems finding a reliable replacement.<br /><br />I decided to upgrade their food to something more nutritious, and tasty, away from Science Diet, which had been their emergency food replacement, and Innova was recommended on a holistic pet nutrition website, as an all wet foot diet (which is supposed to be the next best thing to a raw food diet), so I bought a case on Amazon, hoping for the best.<br /><br />When I opened the can, the cat seemed more interested in sunning at first, but then was soon seen eating half the can, much more than she usually eats.<br /><br />The food has 12% protein content, while Science Diet is only 9%.  It also has Vitamin E, amino acids, mineral chelates, and some vegetables that are good for carnivores.  It doesn't contain any grains or meat by-products, but does have carrageenen, which I believe is a thickener, but I could be wrong.<br /><br />Overall I'm very pleased with this product.  I will be ordering again from this merchant because the process went so smoothly and it arrived at my door sooner than expected.\n",

      "I've been making wine at home for a couple of years now and have over a dozen kits under my belt.  I buy all of my kits at a local brew/wine store and am also somewhat active on an on-line winemaking forum so I'm pretty familiar with the various wine kits available out there.<br /><br />When I ran across these Vino Italiano kits on Amazon I was a bit leery as I had never heard of them before.  They were having a great special at the time, though, so I couldn't afford not to give them a try.<br /><br />I am very pleasantly surprised! It's a small volume kit at 5.1 liters of concentrate, but still makes the typical 6 gallons of wine. The packaging is first class and while the wine is still young (clearing in my carboy) I have every indication it's going to make a nice, red table wine.  If you've come across these and have been hesitant to order, there's no need.  They are quality, small-volume kits AND the even come with labels, corks, and foil tops.  I will buy again in the near future.<br /><br />04-28-2010 Addendum: This wine has been in the bottle for a little over 6 months now and I thought I'd update my initial report.  In a nutshell - this is a very pleasant, medium-bodied, red table wine.  It finished very dry, not fruit forward at all, but at the same time it goes down very easily.  I'd almost refer to it as \"gulpable\".<br /><br />If you're looking for a big, full-bodied Cabernet or Bordeaux style of wine, this kit isn't for you (probably not any of the Vino Italiano kits for that matter).  But if you're looking for a lighter, nice drinking red, I don't think you'll be disappointed.  I'd view this wine as food-friendly and it'll make a great pizza or picnic wine.<br /><br />I plan on making two more of these Vino Italiano kits and giving them a nice long rest in an oak barrel to see how good these kits can be given a little more patience and time.\n",

      "Agree with other reviewers that PB2 is twice as expensive on Amazon so definitely shop around for better deals.  The texture of PB2, when mixed according to directions, is similar to natural peanut butter.  I add an extra 1-2 tsps of water to get a fluffier creamier texture and it doesn't water down the flavor.  It's not bad as a PB substitute and I really wasn't expecting it to be identical to the real thing.  The texture and mouthfeel isn't as satisfying as the real PB, but the flavor is fantastic.  It works best when used as a flavoring agent or substitute rather than eaten as simply a spoon full of PB. I will definitely buy more but from another seller that offers it at a fair price and with very reasonable shipping fees.\n",

      "The previous incarnation of this \"protein\" cereal was acceptable ( nutty tasting, good with fruit) and relatively low in carbs for junk food.  It has been my mainstay for breakfast for years.  I used to travel with it in the days when it was hard to find because I wanted to stay on track with eating while traveling.  I was not the only one to do this: I recall that a business passenger who was on the airliner that landed in the Hudson river a few years ago voiced his distress on air to a reporter that a box of this hard to find cereal was certainly lost along with his luggage.<br /><br />Now I just bought four boxes of the new \"Plus\" version and I am trying to give it away:  sweet, bland, overly dosed with chemical flavors. It has gone from 9 to 19 gr carbohydrate with sugar as its third ingredient.

They are all rescued animals who had very rough lives before coming to me.  I attribute their amazing health in no small part to their food.  I've always given them food with no by-products (Wellness and a few other brands) but when they hit 17, I started noticing a marked decline in their energy levels and appetite.  It wasn't until I tried Innova that the trend reversed itself completely.  They've always had incredibly soft and glossy coats, but the EVO has even improved that too.  My half Bengal's fur truly feels better than silk.  They've been eating the Innova for a year now and play like kittens again.

      "Now Foods' erythritol is a sugar substitute made from corn. By fermenting the corn's sugars, the manufacturer produces a naturally-occurring sugar alcohol product. Sugar alcohols taste exactly like sugar, but without the calories and blood sugar spike. And they are alcohols in chemistry terms only, not to be confused with the kind of alcohol one finds in adult beverages.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />* Tastes just like sugar and has no unpleasant aftertastes, unlike stevia.<br /><br />* Has a glycemic index of zero. Great for diabetics or those simply wishing to eliminate excess sugar from their diets.<br /><br />* Contains virtually no calories.<br /><br />* Made by a manufacturer committed to a wide range of sweeteners and food products, so the company is experienced and trusted in its field.<br /><br />* Erythritol occurs naturally in many foods. The FDA recognizes it as a viable and safe sugar substitute. Erythritol-based sweeteners have been on the market in other countries for years.<br /><br />* Unlike some other sugar alcohols such as xylitol, mannitol, and sorbitol, it will not cause gas if consumed in large amounts.<br /><br />* Not only does erythritol not promote tooth decay, it actually prevents it, inhibiting the growth of harmful bacteria in the mouth.<br /><br />* Can be used in baking.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />* Not quite as sweet as sugar. You need about a quarter to a third more erythritol by volume for an equivalent.<br /><br />* Though it tastes exactly like sugar, erythritol has a slight, mint-like, cooling effect on the tongue. In foods where that effect would be undesirable, erythritol would need to be combined with another sweetener to diminish the effect. (This effect seems to vary from person to person, too.)<br /><br />* In some clear liquids such as tea, adding erythritol will initially cloud the liquid, though the cloudiness fades quickly. (That issue probably comes from the release of oxygen bubbles as the product dissolves.)<br /><br />* Though it dissolves, erythritol does not do so as rapidly as sugar. It will retain its granularity in some foods. (Some people recommended powdering it to compensate.)<br /><br />* Because it involves more steps to make than corn syrup or sugar, this is not a cheap product. Perhaps in the future, economies of scale will drive the price down.<br /><br />Many companies are discovering the benefits of erythritol as a natural sugar substitute that lacks the nagging questions that dog artificial sweeteners like sucralose and aspartame. Now Foods' erythritol is one of the best values in this natural sweetener on the market, available at a much lower price point than some competitors' products. Though not cheap compared with sugar or some artificial sweeteners, as a healthy alternative, it more than makes up for its higher cost.<br /><br />Definitely recommended.\n",

      "I litter-box trained my small dog almost 7 years ago before there was such a thing as dog litter on the market.  (I just used cat litter.) However, the problem with cat litter in my situation was that I kept the litter box outside and when it rained, the cat litter became a sloshy mess.  When I saw that this dog litter had come out, I switched in the hope that my dog would be able use it even when it rained (especially during the rainly months -- when you might have a light rain every day or other day).  This stuff is pretty good with the rain.  In a light rain it will dry up with out much of a problem in the sun.  In a heavier rain, the pellets absorb the water and become larger then usual but they do not create a sloshy mess.  So my dog can use the box during or after the rain and then it is not so hard to clean out and replace the litter.  I only have 3 comments with respect to this litter other than the foregoing: (1) the pellets, in my opinion, are probably a bit too large for dogs with small feet, (I would suggest that they be made smaller or at least more narrow -- it took my dog a while to get use to this), (2) cat litter that clumps really make it much easier to keep the rest of the litter completely clean (although this is not so bad but you end up using more litter because you have to scoop a lot out to make sure that you get all of the waste matter and liquid, and (3) because this does not have clumping properties you probably have to replace this more often because it tends to smell bad more quickly then kitty litter (about once a week).  Otherwise, I think this is a pretty good product.  I would definitely recommend it for indoor or outdoor use.\n",

      "We have a new puppy, and are attempting to train her using a rewards-based system. This works well, except that we don't feel comfortable giving her treat after treat after treat. Then, along came the Lickety Stik, and it solved our problem! Our puppy LOVES this, and it's become an invaluable training tool. We have bought several in different flavors and keep them in different rooms around the house. When our puppy is doing something she shouldn't be doing, we give her the appropriate command (\"Off,\" \"Wrong,\" \"Leave It\" etc.). If she does what she's asked, we say \"Good Girl!\" grab the Lickety Stik, and she gets a couple of licks. This has worked amazingly well, and we're not stuffing the puppy with treats. There are some times when we feel she'll continue the bad behavior just to get a Lickety Stik, but that's the same with any treat. To solve this, once we know she understands the command, if she continues to do the behavior, she doesn't get the treat. She soon realizes that to get the Lickety Stik, she has to not do the behavior at all.<br /><br />Of course, your dog may be different, but this has been our experience.<br /><br />Also, my daughter is working at a local pet store as a grooming assistant, and she tells me that they have started using the Lickety Stik there to help calm their dogs and curb bad behavior while they're being groomed. I felt that was a pretty good endorsement right there.\n",

      "I have a couple of dogs, one of which, loves to chew on bones. I gave it to my dog as a Christmas treat and it went to town. But later I found little splinters on the floor. It did not register to me at first since it had lost the meat flavoring color and it was pure white. Still being oblivious at the time, I tried to give the same dog another one, seeing how he loved the first one, and he just walked the other way. Then after my dog threw up, the bone splinter riddle was solved.<br />Later, my daughter, who works at a dog adoption organization, told me that I should have never given my dog pork bones... at least not the dried out variety. Perhaps this won't be a problem for your dog but my dog can really chew thru bone... so maybe that was it. In any case, lesson learned for me with my dogs.

      "I have just recently begun using VCO for nearly all of my cooking.  After purchasing two books on the benefits of coconut oil, I have purchased several different brands of oil.  The Nutiva Organic EVCO is by far a superior oil with a delightful flavor.  The price from Amazon if you are a Prime member is the best I have found for this quality of oil.<br /><br />I began eating the oil mixed in about 1/2 cup of cottage cheese because I read on a forum that cottage cheese has properties which help the body assimilate the oil.  Since then I have expanded to many other uses.  I use the oil to sautee garlic, onions, peppers, etc for all of my soups and stir frys.  I spread it on toast and add it to my corn bread.<br /><br />In just the first week of eating coconut oil regularly I noticed that my chronic aches in my joints and muscles subsided.  My skin is smoother and blemishes began to disappear.  I began using it as a topical ointment on my hands, feet and face along with knees and elbows.  It is a much better skin conditioner than almost anything else I have used.<br /><br />I found that it also works great as a conditioner for all of my wooden cooking utensils and I rub it into my cutting boards to condition them.  It is far superior to mineral oil!<br /><br />I have introduced the oil into my husband's diet also.  He has been a Type II diabetic for about 15 years and just turned 77.  He is beginning to notice positive benefits also.  He particularly has noticed more mental acuity.  He adds the oil to his morning cereal and spreads it on his toast and really enjoys the flavor.<br /><br />I am so happy to have found this wonderful Nutiva oil and appreciate its many benefits.  I find it kind of addictive.  I now look forward to adding the oil to more and more foods and it seems to make nearly everything, including eggs, soups, stews, casseroles, muffins and breads more delicious.  I highly recommend the Nutiva brand of Organic EVCO for a huge variety of uses.  To those who think it has too much coconut flavor - well, I guess you can't please everyone.  Try it and decide for yourself.  The health benefits are worth it!  This oil has given me a new energy and improved my health so positively that I would recommend it to everyone.<br /><br />The only downside I can mention is the plastic container.  It would be better if it were packaged in glass, but hopefully all those anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and anti-viral properties of the oil will negate the use of a plastic container ;-)\n",

When I recieved it in the mail, It was in good green condition and looked very healthy BUT it was tiny, it had one half inch leaf growing from the tiny stem.

It's healthier than I ever though, It has probably 75 leaves on it and it approx. 2 feet tall. Which is great for what I had gotten.

Frank's is a hot sauce you can use more liberally to your liking because, while it's hot, it's not so hot you can't really dig into it and enjoy the rich flavor and spices.<br /><br />I like to use this sauce to dip chicken tenders in, but you can also use it too cook buffalo wings, put it on eggs, French fries, burgers, whatever you like.<br /><br />This size really is way too small to purchase.  If you like hot sauce you will be done with this size bottle in no time and kick yourself for not buying a larger, more economical size.<br /><br />I highly recommend this hot sauce.\n",

      "I have had a \"twitching eyelid\" problem for over a month now.  I've had that happen a few times here and there in the past, but never like this.  This was really getting bothersome, it was doing it like every 30 minutes or so for a few seconds at a time.  From the time I woke up till the time I went to bed.  It go so bad last week, I looked up again online about it...and somehow came across a forum where someone had the same problem and someone replied \"you have a magnesium deficiency\".  Well then I started looking up magnesium deficency and came upon this product.  I went and bought it the next day a local store.  And guess what??  My eye twitching has almost completely come to a STOP!!!  From something that was getting to be every 20-30 min. to now it does it about 2-3 times a day, much less noticable too, the twitching isn't as severe or bothersome.<br /><br />So I would have given this 5 stars, but I am still waiting to see if this supplement helps with any of the other problems, I've noticed after reading about magnesium deficiencies.  Those would be an added bonus if it helped with my other symptoms.  I am starting out with a small amount and will work my way up, and see if it gets any better with other things.  But I think it's great for just helping with my eye, it was literally driving me crazy!!<br />So glad I came upon this product...and the taste is really not bad at all.  I mix it with a whole glass of cold water, and it really only tastes like water with a lemon wedge in it, to me anyway...Maybe a larger amount of it, in less water might be too sweet, but it's really diluted in a full glass of water, so it isn't bad at all.\n",

I don't know if they work yet as I am not due to have a cholesterol lab until the end of January.  One word of caution, don't chew these and take a drink of cool water afterwards.  What is left of the chew in your mouth will stick to the roof of your mouth like glue.  I take these in the middle of a meal and that does the trick.\n",

      "So many black teas (such as pu-erh and yunnan) are so strong and stark, that to find a tea like this (which is assam and ceylon with herbs) is a real treat. First off, make no bones about it, this is a black tea. It has that strong, bitter taste to it that I look forward to from a black tea. However, the aroma is just incredible. Between the cloves and the cinnamon, it's almost as if you've opened up a box of christmas. The tea itself is very rich and very dark. It produces a little froth on its own, mainly I think because the leaves are so broken up. You'll want a very fine filter, there is sediment through the filter we use.<br /><br />The tea itself has a very strong character of both clove and orange, with cinnamon making the tea very much \"spicy.\" Not spicy enough to detract from the rest of the tea, but certainly enough to get your attention. The box mentions there are 3 kinds of cinnamon in the tea as well. This much I'd believe. I know there are at least two kinds -- Sri Lanka and Madagascar -- of cinnamon, it seems reasonable to me that a third might be adding the \"sweet\" flavor that the other reviewer mentioned.<br /><br />It is really just an amazing tea that I think most people will find themselves going through quickly. It's a nice break from the standard black tea fare, if that's what you normally drink.<br /><br />I can compare it to Rishi Tea's \"The Fire\" (another \"spicy\" tea), and the big difference here is the body. Rishi's offering has a very light boody, whereas this tea almost tastes like it's had molasses added. Yum. All the spice, and character to boot.<br /><br />Highly recommended.\n",

As a whole piece, the treats might be a little large for her, but they can be broken in two very easily.  The bag actually shows you how to break them in two, of course it's pretty self-explanatory as each treat has a cut down the middle of them.  So, the actual size of the treat should not be an issue for those with large or small dogs!  As far as taste--of course I can only rely on how well our dog likes them-she loves them.  Of course she is a little piggy and likes everything, but she really seems to be more fond of these than cheaper treats we have given her.

      "I bought this tea after reading a superb recommendation for it from a reliable source. I was a little wary about buying sight unseen, but I have to say the flavor matches the outstanding health benefits of this tea. Not surprising, since most quality items that are grown with care tend to excel in flavor as well.<br />This tea is very dry and shriveled, so the package is really packed. I usually get 3-4 cups of great tea per two tablespoons of leaves. This tea is meant to be used up pretty fast. In fact, this package should be used up in about six months, so the size is about right.<br />I find the flavor holds up well, with or without a sweetener. Goes well with honey (I prefer it straight).<br />Nutritional information is on the package, independent lab tested, but this tea is carefully cultivated and it really is a cut above anything else I have found on the market.<br />Great buy for an exceptional product.

      "For those of us brought up on Vegemite, Marmite doesn't make the grade.  For those brought up on Marmite, Vegemite seems a poor substitute.  For Americans who only seem to put sweet stuff on their cake (oops, I mean \"bread\") both are revolting.<br /><br />I think that a major reason why Americans abhor these savoury spreads is that being used to spreading honey and jam on their breakfast toast, they tend to use like quantities of Vegemite or Marmite.  To uninitiated the taste of either spread applied so lavishly is going to be overwhelming.  Before passing judgment on these spreads, you would do well to heed the advice of \"Joanna\" or \"mtspace\" and apply thinly. It also works best with very fresh bread or hot toast.<br /><br />Incidentally, I believe that Marmite was first.  Vegemite was an Australian imitation created several years later.  It was originally called Parwill - a pun which will be appreciated by Aussies and Brits but which may not be understood by Americans because of the way the words are pronounced.<br /><br />I only give Marmite four stars.

I mix a little in with his dry dog food and he devours it.  i was suprised when i first opened the can because it looked watery and there were whole chicken wings with bones and all not what your accustume to when you open a can of dog food. However, the chicken wings fall apart easily and are very soft the bones literally turn to mush. It looks like whole chicken wings in gravy that have cooked in the crock pot allday and it smells wonderful.  I have tried other high quality brands and he would quit eating them after a day or two.  He eats this every time and it looks like homemade food that I would eat. His coat is glistening and soft and he has great energy. I can't wait to try the other flavors I'll let you know if he likes them. I'm going to switch his dry food to merrick when his Inova is gone.\n",

The meat is about 1/4 inch (6-7 mm) thick and comes in a fairly easy, peel open package.  Taste is good though on the salty side (it carries more than 1/2 the daily recommended amount of salt).  It does not actually taste like steak, just jerky, but the meat is pretty tender and I didn't feel like I was wrestling with shoe leather.

      "I am an Earl Grey fan, and I am currently enjoying a thermos of Stash's Double Bergamot as we speak. The citrus background of the standard Earl Grey mix is definitely amped up, making it into the central focus of the tea (as opposed to the black tea base). It is obvious you are still drinking tea, mind you, but now the bergamot flavoring is a lot more transparently citrus in origin.<br /><br />Cup by cup is probably the best way to make it your first time out. Making it by the traditional \"full pot\" method of \"1 per person and 1 per pot\" (and for me, often \"1 extra just for the fun of it\") makes the taste borderline spicy. This is how I first sampled it and it caused me to cough upon my initial swallow because I knew it was strong but was not quite expecting that level of strength. I recommend a little bit of honey and a little bit of milk to help bring the taste into roundness.<br /><br />Like Lapsang Souchong, this tea has a distinctive flavor that seems perfect for waking you up on a cold morning or refreshing you after a long day's hike. It gives me a little extra perk at work, and I like that.<br /><br />However, I cannot five star this tea because the flavor is a little too intense for the more casual drinker. I like having tea socially, and sharing it with my friends. Most of them outright dislike this one or only sip it sparingly (just like the aforementioned Lapsang Souchong).<br /><br />Earl Grey fans, however, can rest assured that it is a five star review for them.\n",

Whole grains, no processed sugar, etc.  And at 140 calories per bag, not too bad in that respect either.  3 grams of fiber and 3 grams of protein isn't too shabby, but with ingredients like quinoa and all the other whole grains, I was a little surprised that it wasn't more.  But maybe I have unreasonable expectations.<br /><br />The only problem was when I stated it.  The chips were hard, and my immediate reaction was that they had gone stale.  They had that 'stale taste' as well, if you know what I mean.  But with the bag just opened that moment, and an expiration date over a year in advance, I'm apt to believe that this is just how they're supposed to be.

My sister Ruth won a prize with it in a cooking show, and she shared it with permission in Flavored with Love: Mary Lou's Family and Friends Can Cook.<br /><br />Ruth's Prize-Winning Broccoli Salad<br />4 cups broccoli<br />½ cup raisins<br />½ cup onion<br />½ cup nuts<br />½ cup celery<br />½ cup real bacon bits<br />½ cup light mayonnaise<br />½ cup sugar<br />¼ cup vinegar (apple cider or white)<br /><br />Mix the first 6 ingredients.  Make a sauce out of the mayonnaise, sugar, and vinegar.  Pour the sauce over the salad. Toss and chill.<br /><br />Lately we are paying more attention to nutrition.  Raisns have 130 calories in a 1/4 cup serving.  There are condensed food.  They contain no fat. They have natural sugar with a large carbohydrate load.  One serving has almost no sodium but 310 mg potassium.  Diabetics and renal patients should consult with their dieticians before including raisins in their diets.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy Ruth's recipe and find this review helpful.\n",

      "Got these steaks as a Christmas gift. Four steaks for 90 bucks could be worth it, but in this case it's a scam. They market these as a quality of beef you can't buy in stores but that is simply not the case. There is very little marbling in the steaks and they are Choice beef at best. But let's not forget that Omaha refuses to actually use a USDA rating for their beef. They just use fancy words to make it sound like you are getting amazing steaks when in reality if they were that amazing they would be prime cuts and labeled as such. Take my word for it and go with a company that offers USDA Prime steaks, there are plenty if you just google it. Also, last time I was at costco they actually had a good selection of Prime strip steaks at a price that is cheaper than these. The only reason I did not rate as 1 star is because 3 of the 4 steaks I received had a larger portion of filet than you typically expect with a t-bone. Still, find the prime and stay away from this low quality but well marketed beef.\n",

      "Since this honey professes to be raw (actually, it is warmed/heated) and unfiltered (actually, they tell you on the label in small print that they filter it) I was prepared for little bits and floaters to be in it, but it is clear as a bell.

Its color is a nice rich amber.<br /><br />The bottles are easy to handle but I get nervous about handling them with the pour spout when they are full as the cap isn't the most securely fitting thing in the world.  It just feels weak to me.  They arrived really well packed for transit so I didn't experience any messy losses due to shipping.<br /><br />The manufacturers might want to consider redoing their label as the information they provide is confusing:  Raw & Unfiltered verses the fine print stating that it is heated/warmed & filtered.  It matters a lot to some folks and is the only reason I docked a star.  Regardless, the honey rocks.\n",

      "I adopted my 4 1/2 year-old brown tabby, a little more than a month ago. According to his medical history from the shelter, he'd had frequent diarrhea and they gave him deworming medicine which apparently made him throw up and still didn't fix the problem. They told me the problem will soon go away since he had been just treated, so i didn't worry about it too much and took him home with me.<br /><br />The very next day, he had a very runny stool with dark blood spots at the end! Being a first time cat owner, I got scared and took him to the vet and she said his fecal exam result showed nothing out of ordinary and blood in stool is common for cats.I thought it would go away since I was starting to feed him good quality food, but it didn't.<br />I kept seeing blood and loose stools in his litter box and whenever he had normal poop occasionally, I would get very happy since it didn't happen so often. Oh, and he was one gassy cat!<br /><br />I did my research and tried to put him on a raw diet but being a student, I just couldn't afford the time and the money. I heard canned food is better than dry, so I got him all-natural premium canned food but it didn't solve the problem.<br />I have to admit he didn't seem to like it at first. He LOVED the previous food, but he just sniffed at the new food and walked away. It took him a couple days to get used to eating it. It's been about a week and no more diarrhea!! He's had healthy, normal poop for a week and I haven't detected any gas from him!! I still give him the same canned food, but he mostly eats the Natural Balance dry food. He doesn't go crazy over it but he seems pretty content with it, so I can't complain! It's a big, I mean BIG, relief!\n",

We are very pleased with all items in the box.<br /><br />With that said, My only real complaint is price.  The 4.4 pounds includes everything - even the packaging.  The quantities are not being shown in the product description as I write this review.  This is not a lot more than a product sampling package, yet the Amazon price at this moment is an even $40.  That works out to very expensive \"per ounce pricing\" if you purchased each of the items individually.<br /><br />But there is one additional positive.  It's become common to expect \"gift baskets\" and other types of gift selections to be priced very high.  If you're willing to pay the money for a very nice gift, that's exactly what you'll be giving - a very nice gift.<br /><br />Had it not been for the pricing, this would have been a very solid 4-star rating (we give VERY few 5-star ratings - they truly have to be the best of the best to get 5 stars from us.\n",

      "I spent 5 years studying canine nutrition and sadly, learned that vets don't ever get this chance. Veterinary colleges are funded by dog food companies and unfortunately, as one famous vet who wants to change all that, Dr. Pitcairn, realized, taught to treat the problem rather than discovering what's causing it and that usually relates to the diet. In fact, a tremendous increase in dog health issues can be traced back to the time that dog food companies started...when they stopped eating table scraps and began an all-processed high grain and high allergen and unnatural diet. Even though table scraps were full of dog toxins like onions, they STILL had less health issues than their process food preservative and poor balance counterparts of today.<br /><br />Funny how we wouldn't feed our kids crackers every day but feel it's okay to only feed our dogs that--high grain, poor protein, cooked out vitamins, highly processed, low nutrients...dogs who, in nature, seek out more protein.<br /><br />In fact, that is how new dog food nutrition studies began. Because vets realized that wolves and coyotes in the wild brought in for treatment if hit by a car, etc do not have the health issues our INDOOR dogs have. A wolf might be old and without fleas or tartar or itching and with a glossy coat.<br /><br />So vets like Dr. Pitcairn began studying the cause of pets with chronic issues or developing common issues too young and finding what things were toxic and unnatural and what helped prevent poor things in their diet.<br /><br />I live in the woods and have 3 dogs and have yet to have one flea because I follow this advice. In fact, I have strangers tell me (often) that my dog's fur looks like a cat's because it's so shiny. No itching. Never grew up begging for my food because theirs is complete. (It may be hard to break this habit once begun but easy if it never starts.)<br /><br />I will only feed them 3 things: a diet I make from Dr. Pitcairn's recommendations, ( I have no ties to any of these but am an activist about sharing anything good or bad for pets)  Newman's Own canned dog food, or Flint River Ranch.<br />Why? First of all, as part of my own studies I visited dog food plants. Actually this was like the biggest wakeup call on the planet for me.  I watched as I was told the \"brilliant\" model of putting the factories near cattle processing. When a cow is dead or dying of anything...they never determine the cause...they pick it up in a bulldozer and go take it to the dogfood plant. I WATCHED this.<br /><br />How can they do this? Do you see how you rarely see the term \"human grade meat\" on dog food? They don't have to be inspected if it's dog food. There are two different levels of acceptance...people cannot eat food riddled with tumors from lesions or cancer, it's okay if dog's do. According to the government regulations.  Humans are required to eat inspected meat of certain cleanliness standards and from cows processed for this reason (I don't eat meat anyway but still....)Dog food companies are not required to have such standards.<br /><br />For reals.<br /><br />So if you will recall the huge outbreak of botulism a few years back with sick dogs going to vets, dying, etc that they linked to dog foods then it happened a few months later...do you remember there were only about 5 companies that were labeled as unaffected? This was one, Newman's Own was one....why? They only use HUMAN GRADE meat. Their meat is inspected. They do not buy meat from downed cattle plants so they were released from any recall or report of possible affected products. The others bought meat from across the country at these places and it was found the cows were diseased but because they never have to check to find out what they cows died from when making them into food, it was passed along. Then it happened again a few months later. Then it happened again a year later. Yes, we hear about these things when dogs die en masse. We never, however, hear about dogs that just fall ill....<br /><br />But it gets worse.  You may see a list of vitamins and nutrients across the back of a bag of dog food. But due to the way meat is processed, they bake it at astronomically high temps to try to kill off any lesions, puss, etc. I\"m not making this up. But they ARE required to have these in there...so what happens? They all bake off. You are left with some grains, high allergens like corn, and you are basically feeding your dog crackers and by-products of downed cattle.<br /><br />So, does your dog beg and salivate when you eat meat or any dinner for that matter? Does your dog dive into the grass to try to get greens and nutrients by eating grass when you go for a walk?<br /><br />There is a reason.  In nature, if you gave a human baby a banana and a bunny they would pet the bunny and eat the banana. If you gave a hungry dog the same for dinner, they'd eat the bunny first. What part of the bunny do they eat first? the stomach.  Why? This is where they get their greens and nutrients...then the meat protein. The raw bones clean their teeth without splintering.<br /><br />Yet, although we are against eating an all-processed diet, dogs in spite of begging and pleading, are now living shorter lives, with the highest health issues ever due to our thinking that it's better for them because a dog food company told us so...or vets who don't have classes in nutrition tell us so. But this isn't taught in veterinary schools and dog food companies fund and provide text books etc. I didn't say this...vets say this.<br /><br />That is changing. There is a huge off-shoot of vets now learning to find the issue and the cause (usually food related) rather than treating the issue alone.  And it turns out most issues are cured by a proper diet.<br /><br />In fact, look at your dog treats. If you see sugar in them you will realize how many dog food companies are motivated by money. And there are lots of dog treats even TARTAR CLEANING (they say) dog treats with sugar. Why? Your dog will crave them just like people do. You may also see loads of unnnatural ingredients and even toxins such as onion powder. Milo's dog treats have these. Your dog can't tell you what is slowly hurting their kidneys. It's up to you to read the labels. Dog food is not regulated. It's up to us to do that.<br /><br />The first thing you will notice about this dog food is that it looks like cookies broken a part rather than machine-made little round circles. Why? Because it it. They use inspected human-grade meat and a balance of carbs, protein, etc. that is closer to the natural diet and what a dog needs. Then they can bake it at a regular temperature that doesn't bake these out, just like you would at home. The nutrients aren't baked out. They bake it in sheets, naturally, then just break them apart.<br /><br />You may be skeptical...so give it a month or two. Take a picture of your dog's fur before (dead serious) then compare it to when it has time to grow after eating this....you will be SHOCKED. We show poor health in our hair and so do they.<br /><br />I can actually walk up to people at a dog event and tell them what they feed their dog. I have yet to be wrong and I do it often. I don't mean what brand but even people who think they are feeding their dog premium food like Iams have no idea it's just processed crackers marked up and grains and downed cattle.<br /><br />I actually point out to people the difference. I kid you not, a family barbecue, a neighborhood \"house crawl\", a restaurant that allows dogs outside....I can walk up and tell who gives their dog table scraps (without toxins like onions or avocados) or real food, or human grade food....I just say \"what do you feed your dog?\" and I've never been wrong. Their coats are SHOCKINGLY different and shinier, the dogs aren't itching, and they usually have better teeth and gums.  I have yet to be wrong.<br /><br />One lady told me how she took her dog to vets for years and it had to have steroid shots, then she finally found a vet who knew about nutrition rather than saying \"feed him expensive dog food\" and assumed that was good...and the dog was cured.<br /><br />Do I work for this company? No. I am a very active Amazon reviewer who speaks up heavily, especially when it comes to pets, in all my reviews of things I love or things I don't.  My dogs thrive on this but I will say, they are not fans of their dog treats. So I just look at labels and find all natural dog treats (charlee bear brand has good ones) I have no ties to this company whatsoever except for the fact that I used to only feed my dogs food I made until a vet who was an expert in nutrition told me about this (In fact this vet ALWAYS treats from the cause rather than the symptoms first...a rarity as to how vets are taught to heal.)<br /><br />this was at a time I was too busy to cook and I didn't want to give my dog just canned food even though Newman's Own is equally as good as this...<br /><br />the difference in coat was striking.  I have tried a couple other brands and one of my poms always starts scratching. This has amino acids and things that treat the coat and skin and it's perfectly balanced.<br /><br />Depending upon where you live it may be cheaper to buy direct. I anxiously await the day they finally get this on Amazon with free shipping but it has not happened yet. I'd get it on subscription then.<br /><br />There is a difference. There is a huge difference. I've spent years studying in order to be informed and I recommend few dog foods. This, however, in my opinion, is simply one that no other dog food has ever come close to when I read ingredients and balance of ingredients and look at how it's made and what kind of meat.<br /><br />If you ate artificial and processed chicken mcnuggets every day you'd fall ill too. When our dogs do people rarely suspect the dog food...they live such short lives anyway....nothing should be off balance, artificial, preservative-laden, processed, etc in their diets either so that even if they live a long life it is a full and healthy one with less arthritis, less kidney issues, less scratching etc.<br /><br />I am a raving fan.\n",

So I find myself drinking lots of tea.<br /><br />When I purchased my Keurig, I also bought a selection of teas from Celestial Seasonings, which included their Earl Grey and English Breakfast. After using them up, I decided to try the Earl Grey from Twinings for K-cups but was disappointed. The flavor was quite weak, not to say everyone likes a strong tea, but those who enjoy the sophisticated taste of Earl Grey, often like it to have a bolder taste then what this produced. Also it left a lot of unpleasant tea powder at the bottom of the tea cup which gave the cup of tea an unappealing appearance of being dirty.<br /><br />I would have just assumed that this was the best a Keurig maker could do to produce a cup of tea if I hadn't already had 2 boxes of Celestial Seasoning teas that produced stronger tea with no muddy appearance. I was quite surprised with this result because I ordered the Twinings tea with the assumption that it would be better then the Celestial Seasoning.<br /><br />Not my favorite K-cup tea for the Keurig.\n",

      "Picked up a set of 2 at the local home improvement store for ~$11.  The design of this trap seems to count on the animal pushing dirt in front of him and the dirt is what sets off the trap.  In these instances, the gopher will likely be caught behind the neck or shoulders.  I see a lot of holes on our property where the hole is not plugged and plenty of sign that he has been out scampering around.  In these cases, he'll get caught in the hip area with his nose up against where the trigger plate would be set.  This just makes it a little more awkward in emptying the trap.  The cinch type trap looks to be just as effective but much easier to empty.  The cinch trap will cost up to 2-3 times more, though.  I might get one or two cinch traps, but 9/10 will be the 610 type.<br /><br />I have read at least one review where the sweep of the jaws could be an issue, preventing the trap from being seated in small holes and from closing effectively.  This is really easy to work around.  I first thought to shorten the jaws, but decided to just make the hole bigger when setting it.  I learned that gophers are not shy of these traps or your activity around the hole.  In very short order you can excavate the hole to a size that allows the trap to operate freely...and the gopher will come...especially if you notice fresh activity around the hole.<br /><br />Much of the literature on setting traps recommends digging back from the plugged hole to access the main tunnel and then set the traps in pairs so the gopher has to enter a trap from either direction in order to replug the hole.  I have found this is not really necessary.  If the hole I am working was freshly plugged, one trap in the hole works every time.<br /><br />I also noticed that a small plug doesn't necessarily mean a small gopher.  In one instance, I almost passed on setting a trap in what I thought was just going to be wasted effort.  I cleared dirt from a plug the size of a 50 cent piece and it opened up into a tunnel about 2 1/2 inches!  The gopher I got out of that hole was a normal sized gopher!<br /><br />I also read that a 3 degree difference in the gopher's comfort zone in the burrow is enough to cause him to do something about it.  The fact that light appears at a point he previously plugged is also enough for him to quickly come back and see what happened.  One the first day I used these, I set one, then walked about 30 yards away and set another.  I checked the first one on the way back a few minutes later and found it had been tripped and completely covered.  I had to dig it out and found the little bugger had pushed a rock the size of a bird's egg into it!  My first catch was a rock!  A Bill Murray moment flashed through my mind.  That gopher is now history, by the way.<br /><br />I am working with only 2 traps at the moment and secure them with a piece of butcher twine to my tunnel probe or a 12\" piece of 1/4 in re-bar.  This size hardware is probably overkill.  You can probably tie the traps to those marking flags on wire type stems available at your local home improvement store, especially if you are setting a lot of traps.  They may not need to be secured at all.  When that gopher's body in in the trap, he isn't really going anywhere.  If he can go anywhere with it, it might be best to let THAT gopher keep it as a souvenir!<br /><br />If you are not having any success at all with these traps, it would be a good idea to re-examine how and where the traps are being set.  I have never used these things before and only bought this set after 4 years of poison pellets simply didn't work.  Look for FRESH activity and don't be shy about providing enough room for these traps to work.  So far, have set these only at holes that have been plugged, but will set the next time where there is fresh sign but no plug.  I don't bait mine and the trigger plate can ALWAYS be seen from above after I set them...easier to check them.  From all the mounds on our 2 acres, am guessing we have at least 40 gophers or more.  These traps will be busy and I'll be keeping score.<br /><br />I give the trap 5 stars for effectiveness and 4 stars for the emptying issue.  From my experience, no need to spend a lot of money....these things work.\n",

      "As another poster said, the trick is to just rinse with cold water after cooking. Then the noodles separate and are very tasty.<br /><br />For one serving: I just break the noodles in half (or smaller pieces, just take a bunch and break all at once) to fit into about 1 cup or so of hot water (heated in the microwave), then heat on high uncovered for about 4 min, check to see if it needs a little more zap time (or just leave it for a few more minutes in the hot water). I have a low power microwave (500 W), you will need to experiment. Then rinse with cold water in a collander, and add whatever you want. Then you can warm it up again for a hot dish.<br /><br />The same technique can be used for any kind of pasta, just don't try pure semolina wheat - it disintegrates. A mix with durum wheat or any whole grain pasta of any kind works well. Be careful not to overcook corn pasta, though. Some rice pastas are short-cooking, but Pastariso or Lundgren rice pastas cook longer like any wheat/kamut/spelt pasta. Corn and rice pasta need the cold rinse approach, others might not.\n",

The flavor is spot on--even though a purist may be able to notice the difference, I was very pleased with how close this comes to the real deal!<br /><br />For the price, two cans of the real stuff almost pays for 12 liters of this.  Also, with this syrup, you have the option to how strong or weak you'd like to make each serving.

      "I am from the Caribbean, so I know how coconut milk for cooking should taste.  For many years I have used either a fresh coconut (which to me is a lot of work, with the breaking open the coconut, removing piulp from the hard shell and grating or blending) or canned Asian products (some with strange aftertaste - you have to use entire can unless you freeze remainder).  When I went back home for a visit this year, I saw this powder in the store, bought a pack because I was skeptical, and was amazed.  I use it for cooking and you can make it as creamy as you wish based on your recipe.  I brought some back with me and thought I would have to get it sent in the mail from back home.  I checked Amazon and I am very happy to find this right here. I am not vegan and I know where \"MILK based sodium caseinate\" comes from.<br /><br />If you are looking for a no-hassle authentic tasting coconut milk - this should be your choice!!\n",

      "I was concerned about the effect \"regular\" dog food was having on our dogs. We have one puppy and one senior, so both are in crucial stages. The puppy had bad dandruff and dull, course hair while the senior had various issues throughout his life including seizures and IBD. I decided to try a home cooked diet for them but after the pup developed an allergy I was scared to try anything else on my own. We decided to try Wellness after some research on the natural brands (not to mention a taste test with samples from Pet People).<br /><br />This food has done WONDERS. The pup no longer has dandruff and his coat is shiny and silky. His energy level is also through the roof. Our older dog has always been a veeery picky eater, sometimes going a couple days in between meals if it wasn't appetizing enough for him, but he loves the Wellness food and even eats it dry! No canned mix-ins necessary! Since he started eating it we haven't seen any IBD symptoms and he's acting a lot younger.<br /><br />I wholeheartedly recommend this food, or at least another brand of natural food. I encourage you to compare the ingredients in Wellness to regular food as even  \"high-end\" grocer brands (like Science Diet) contain the same junk as the generic ones!\n",

      "This is the second brand of canned or bottled truffles. Firstly, what type of gadget gets this can to open? I had to use an old fashioned beer can opener which left me with the problem of fishing out the little truffles through a jagged opening. When I finally succeeded, chopped the truffles, and put my nose close to them, there was hardly any aroma. After adding them to the risotto I was making, there still was not much truffle perfume. This is a better quality truffle than the previous brand I'd bought. You actually could get that almost garlic like undertone to the truffle.<br />I've pretty much decided that for a home cook, truffle infused oil of good quality is the way to go.

      "The \"Dynamic Duo,\" (a male Westie and a female Scotty), have been eating Blue Buffalo's Adult Weight Control Chicken and Brown Rice kibble for more than two years. Well, to be entirely honest, they eat equal parts of Blue Buffalo and Natural Ultramix, supplemented with fresh boiled chicken, peas, carrots, and apples - and an occasional can of Halo or Evanger's. So why do we include the Blue Buffalo?<br /><br />First, because it is made from the best ingredients - if you were going to make the stuff yourself, besides chicken, you'd probably include grains like brown rice, barley, oats and rye, (no wheat, corn or soy), and vegetables like tomatoes, potatoes, carrots and sweet potatatoes, not to mention a few extras like blueberries, cranberries and, (I swear), green tea extract.<br /><br />Second, because they actually like it. And if you've got a finicky dog, you know what I'm talkin' about. Our Scotty will eat almost anything, (delicacy prevents me from going into any detail on this point), but our Westie? This is a dog for whom every bite is a thoughtfully considered proposition. Should I eat this? Hmmmmmm? Maybe not. Perhaps I should move it from my bowl to the living room carpet and contemplate it? Ah.... It's Blue Buffalo. I'll eat it.<br /><br />We generally buy the 6 pound bag - that means that we buy more frequently than we would if we were buying the larger sizes - but it's easier to store and stays fresher.<br /><br />Many people are concerned about feeding their dogs \"dry\" food - and to some extent, I share that concern. But when it's a quality product like Blue Buffalo and is fed as part of a \"menu\" that includes other fresh and healthy \"entrees,\" I think that it's an excellent addition to your dog's diet.<br /><br />[This is an up-date to my review: Economic times being what they are, something had to give - so a couple of months ago, we eliminated the Natural Ultramix from our terriers' diets. We also eliminated the canned foods, (my wife is convinced that even a small amount of canned food was contributing to our Scotty's tendency to put on a little extra weight). So we've been feeding them Blue Buffalo exclusively, supplemented with fresh boiled chicken, peas, carrots and apples. This change has had no ill effects on their health or appearence - and they continue to love the stuff. I remain convinced that when it comes to kibble, Blue Buffalo is an outstanding product.]\n",

      "Vienna Plus is my third fully automatic machine. I loved my first, Saeco original Vienna, hated the second, Saeco Incanto classic. The original Vienna worked for 3 years every day, making consistently good espresso before the pump gave. I should have paid for repair, but I succumbed to that stainless steel twinkle and went for Saeco Incanto classic. More expensive for sure. Worse, better said inconsistent, coffee quality, constant small problems relating to built quality concerning the brew group, the grinder and the steamer wand. After a year of irritation a pump seal has failed while making espresso, nothing like a small explosion in the kitchen in the morning, I tell ya. Well, gone back to the trusted Vienna, now with  the plus in the name. Good old days are here again .... Compared to previous- it is a lot quieter, when both grinding and steaming, it is also a lot quicker to warm up then before, steam is ready a mere 15 seconds after pushing the button. Espresso has a beautiful rich crema right out of the box, I didn't have to experiment with grind setting at all. The steaming wand (Panarello) has been redesigned and is now foolproof maker of perfect frothed foam. For the newbie I would like to add that I spent a lot of effort to find the right roast - tasted more than a few before I settled on one (Peerless Coffee Espressp Perfection) that I buy now in 5 lb. bags and keep in the freezer. I should for fairness add that I never want any other coffee through the machine like some decaf or flavored stuff, so I don't miss the alternate ground coffee option that Incanto had. My priority has always been flavor and consistency and that the Vienna Plus delivers. My friends drive miles to \"see me\" and, by the way, get a cup of espresso, praising each one as \"this is the best espresso in the world\".  If that is what you desire, don't get mesmerized by stainless steel shine or computerized display magic and save yourself some money by getting this machine. You won't regret it. And I am unanimous in that. ;)\n",

      "I've been playing with bread recipes for about a year now, both by hand and in our bread maker. After really getting in to studying the science behind a good loaf, I began buying wheat gluten. Even if a recipe doesn't call for it I add a small amount (amount is listed on box of what to add to a loaf so it's failproof).<br /><br />The real test was when I added this to a sour cream bread I've been making for ages in our bread maker and everyone declared it \"the best bread recipe\" I'd made...but it was my old recipe.<br /><br />It really does make it more like the gourmet loaves you might scarf down at a favorite restaurant or like those made with fresh yeast when you are just using the dry yeast packets. It rises better, and the texture is better and I swear the taste is better in our opinion.<br /><br />I can't get wheat gluten at my regular grocery store and it was far more costly at specialty groceries around here...it lasts so I just got the box of it here, with no tax it was a better deal for me. I mean, you get a pack of 8 boxes. Cheap.<br /><br />Negatives: I'd love to be able to order less at the same discount but I took the bags out of the boxes and they take up very little space in my cabinet.

      "We've been eating the Wild Planet tuna for a while (and it's also excellent), and decided to give this a try. It's more expensive, but very very good, with real salmon flavor and texture. It truly is skinless and boneless, and in nice big chunks (it's like a big piece of fish in the can, with maybe some smaller chunks to fill the space and weight needs). And being wild-caught, and in BPA-free cans, there's the added assurance that they're good for you!<br /><br />This would be excellent in a salmon salad, but what I do with it most often is a salmon hash, with sweet potatoes. It's also good mixed into mac & cheese! For those of us who don't have regular reliable sources of fresh wild sockeye this is really a great option.<br /><br />IMPORTANT NOTE: after the comment here I did further research, and the cans for the salmon are NOT, as of mid-2012, BPA-free (the tuna and sardines are). Sorry for the misinformation; I had seen reports that all of the Wild Planet seafood was BPA-free, but apparently (according to the company) there are no Alaska plants working with BPA-free cans and their other tests to date have not been satisfactory.<br /><br />Since it's an occasional rather than everyday for me, and the quality is otherwise so high, I'll keep using this.
